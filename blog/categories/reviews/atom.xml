    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve finished my OSCP shortly before <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">PWKv2</a> was released. Since my experience was pre-update, I didn&rsquo;t want to write a review that might no longer apply. Since then, I&rsquo;ve purchased the updated course materials, but I haven&rsquo;t yet gone back to do the newly added machines as well. I decided to write a quick review nonetheless, because I noticed a misconception about what the OSCP is. So I&rsquo;ll just address those points and not add just another OSCP review for the internet to swallow.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A quick rundown of my experience, I did all the lab machines and all the exam machines within 3 months. I plan to go back and also do the ones that were added by the update, but right now I am too busy with other things. After I do that, maybe I&rsquo;ll update this post or write a new one more focused on the impressions of the update. In terms of the new course materials, which I did review, there&rsquo;s a lot compared to the previous version. In particular, the new Windows section is superb and there are lots of usable snippets for various scenarios in modern environments.</p>

<p>Back to the reason for this post, it&rsquo;s not that I want to add just another post with what I did to prepare and the kind of information that is widely available already through the experiences of so many other successful takers (and you should read those posts and learn the most out of them to help you with your journey). My reason is that I noticed many people consider the OSCP the end all, be all of pentesting and are under the impression that it automatically makes you a pentesting god, while there are others who think it&rsquo;s overrated and that you don&rsquo;t learn much out of it. I consider both these opinion categories wrong. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>

<h3>My 50 cents about the OSCP</h3>

<p>After doing the OSCP and also moving beyond it, I consider it more like a necessary qualification to go through as a baseline for pentesting, much like the bootcamp in an army, training camp of a fight, or the qualifiers to a World Cup. It&rsquo;s hard and diverse enough, but it doesn&rsquo;t cover everything. It&rsquo;s mostly focused on network and web exploitation, along with enumeration and privilege escalation. Achieving it will demonstrate perseverance in front of obstacles, a working pentest methodology and skill, and a reasonable level of experience performing it. From that point, there&rsquo;s a lot on the horizon..going deeper in network and web attacks, exploit development, Active Directory..you realize when you&rsquo;re done that you just passed through a warpgate and now there&rsquo;s a whole lot of new challenges lining up. But the principles you learned through completing it will continue to be usable in your career and in future challenges.</p>

<h3>You get out what you put in</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of several people who jumped into the exam after only going through a few machines in the labs. You are literally robbing yourself of the most valuable thing the OSCP provides. All the lab machines present a wide variety of operating systems (not just the usual flavors of Windows and Linux) and attack vectors. Some machines have different and unique vectors hidden in the attack surface that are way more rewarding than the obvious one. I don&rsquo;t think I used the same exploit more than 2 times in the lab. Each machine was a learning experience by itself. If you&rsquo;re running exploit suggester and throwing kernel exploits until one works, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. Also, the hidden networks present a new challenge, in the way of pivoting, that needs to be solved before even reaching the targets. Not to mention the client side attacks and their difficulties.</p>

<p>Too many people are focusing just on the finality of earning a certification instead of squeezing the most out of all the labs have to offer. And even after you complete every box, don&rsquo;t imagine the exam won&rsquo;t be difficult. But you will be as prepared as you can get. Plus it&rsquo;s fun! If you don&rsquo;t get excited about the prospect of pwning over 50 boxes, why are you doing it in the first place? Your ROI will come from the effort you put into the labs, not from the letters you put on your resume.</p>

<h3>Outdated machines?</h3>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve heard often is the complaint about lab machines being too outdated. Yes, the majority of boxes have older OS flavors..and that&rsquo;s a good thing! You can try your hand at exploits that will teach you things that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise experience in a completely modern environment. This is the foundation you are building, the training you&rsquo;re doing for match day. Plus, you learn to achieve objectives without your favorite tools. How do you transfer files to and from an older Windows machine without Powershell and all other native tools that you&rsquo;re used to? What can you do if you have RCE on a NIX system that&rsquo;s different than the ones you&rsquo;re familiar with? And many more wins that you arrive at from struggling with each challenge you&rsquo;re presented.</p>

<h3>Target audience</h3>

<p>Even with the new course update, which gives you a better starting point than before, I don&rsquo;t believe OSCP should be pursued for beginners. People who want to start in pentesting should first make sure they have their basics covered. Things like networking, system administration on Windows and Linux, programming, they are not basics as in easy and simple things, but as in the necessary foundation to add to with security. Trying to skip them won&rsquo;t end well. Once that is covered, there are lots of resources to prepare you, which I won&rsquo;t touch on here. VulnHub, HackTheBox, Ippsec, they have enough content to keep you busy for years. At some point, you have to dive in, but properly preparing for OSCP is as important an effort as working through it.</p>

<h3>Exam</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard and it&rsquo;s fun. Don&rsquo;t think just because you finished all the lab machines it will be a walk in the park &ndash; it won&rsquo;t ;). But I do believe that doing all the machines is the best way to gauge your readiness for it.</p>

<p>Keeping it short and to the point I intended, these are my thoughts about the OSCP. It&rsquo;s an awesome training experience and challenge. You constantly switch back and forth between frustration and elation. And once you&rsquo;re on the other side..you don&rsquo;t stop there, but you go forward exploring all that new fog of war.</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2018/12/27/my-oswp-review/"/>
    <updated>2018-12-27T18:13:52+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2018/12/27/my-oswp-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to finish 2018 on a strong note, so right before Christmas I&rsquo;ve completed the exam for the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oswp-offensive-security-wireless-professional/">Offensive Security Wireless Professional</a> (OSWP) certification. This is my review for the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/offensive-security-wireless-attacks/">Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (WiFu)</a> course. But as a short summay, the course and exam were great, very practical and applicable, and I thoroughly enjoyed them!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>{% img center /images/study/oswp/oswp.png &lsquo;oswp&rsquo; &lsquo;oswp&rsquo; %}</p>

<h2>The course</h2>

<p>The course consists of PDF material, videos, a BackTrack ISO and packet captures. The labs are hardware dependent, so you are supposed to procure your own hardware in order to practice the attacks. For my wireless card, I&rsquo;ve used Alfa AWUS036NHA and have been very happy with its performance. In the course, BackTrack is being used as the operating system, but I&rsquo;ve done the labs on Kali with minimal to none difference in commands.</p>

<p>As a testimony to the applicability of what you learn in the course, the author is none other than Thomas d'Otreppe de Bouvette, the creator of the Aircrack-NG suite! The material is very well structured and explained, you can practice what you&rsquo;re taught and see immediate results. Most chapters also contain a troubleshooting section with tips on what to try if you run into problems.</p>

<p>Almost half of the course written material revolves around the description of Wifi internals, how it works, how packets look like, hardware and drivers consideration. There are PCAP examples for what is being discussed, and it is really useful if you want to understand what is happening under the hood.</p>

<p>After that, it&rsquo;s all attacks and the stuff we&rsquo;re interested in! The focus of the course materials is the Aircrack-NG suite of tools, as expected, since it&rsquo;s the de facto choice for wireless security auditing. You learn how to place your wifi card on monitor mode, how to sniff traffic, how to do packet injection and ultimately crack the keys for different network scenarios. You also learn how to find hidden SSIDs and bypass MAC filtering.</p>

<p>The attacks you perform are targeted at different network types. There are multiple scenarios for WEP networks that use open authentication, shared key authentication, or have no associated clients. The labs go over multiple attacks: interactive packet replay attacks, fragmentation attacks, KoreK ChopChop attacks.</p>

<p>The most applicable part is the WPA/WPA2 cracking section, as these are the networks you&rsquo;ll run into most often nowadays. Dictionary and rainbow table attacks are being demonstrated with multiple tools. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the addition in the course material of Cowpatty and Pyrit. Also, you&rsquo;re shown how to leverage John&rsquo;s rules to enhance an already existing wordlist that&rsquo;s used with Aircrack-NG.</p>

<p>At the end of the course, you also get to see Kismet and Karmetasploit in action, along with rogue AP and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<h2>The exam</h2>

<p>{% img center /images/study/oswp/skills.png &lsquo;oswp skills&rsquo; &lsquo;oswp skills&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>The exam was really enjoyable, I didn&rsquo;t find it too hard or too easy. If you practice the labs in the course, you will be well prepared for the exam. I really liked that the exam takes almost 4 hours, as that allowed me to also work on the report as I was going through each attack. I&rsquo;ve experienced some laggy bits and a disconnection here and there, but overall, the exam experience was great.</p>

<h3>Concluding remarks</h3>

<p>I could think of no better course for wireless hacking, but as I was reading reviews of other people&rsquo;s experiences, I saw some criticism concerning this particular course. I will share my thoughts on the critiques below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The course is outdated</em>. It looks like the course was last updated in 2014, and the videos and labs make use of BackTrack. But these don&rsquo;t detract from its value at all. I used Kali for the course, and I think only 2 times I had to slightly alter the commands for use on Kali. It would make no sense to re-record everything just to be on Kali, since there are almost no differences between them. Also, the wifi landscape hasn&rsquo;t changed that much, so the material is highly relevant and you can put into practice what you learn right away. But I do agree that the course would be even better with a section of WPA enterprise attacks and WPS cracking.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The material is too WEP-centric</em>. It&rsquo;s true that today you won&rsquo;t really see WEP that much. But that&rsquo;s not to say that there are no WEP networks left in the world. Seeing how vulnerable they are in reality and being able to crack different types of WEP networks is a skill that you should have, regardless of how rare you&rsquo;ll get to see them. So for me, this wasn&rsquo;t a weak point at all, I found it very interesting.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The exam is too easy</em>. I&rsquo;ve also seen several opinions claiming that the exam was too easy. But this only attests to the quality of the material, if you can perform the attacks you&rsquo;re being taught, you will succeed. Maybe as an enhancement to the exam, besides cracking the keys, there could be some objectives like decrypting the traffic of a certain client to discover something, or performing MitM. But I was happy with the quality of the exam, in fact, I tried to make the most of it by going through the attacks with more than one tool.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, OSWP was awesome, and stay tuned for more!</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2018/11/11/social-engineering-expert-course-review/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-11T13:17:57+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2018/11/11/social-engineering-expert-course-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently taken the <a href="https://redteam-training.thinkific.com/courses/social-engineering-expert">Social Engineering Expert</a> from <a href="https://www.redteamsecure.com/">RedTeam Security</a>. If you don&rsquo;t know about them, check out their articles and videos about their engagements, they&rsquo;re doing some really cool stuff. In this post I will share my impressions about the course.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First of all, the author of the course is also the founder of RedTeam Security, Jeremiah Talamantes. He&rsquo;s authored a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineers-Playbook-Practical-Pretexting/dp/0692306617/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452290969&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=social+engineers+playbook&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=talamantesus-20&amp;linkId=1f8b9cac92cdd16ae8d1956668d9942b">The Social Engineer’s Playbook: A Practical Guide to Pretexting</a>
, which I haven&rsquo;t tried yet. He is clearly very experienced and throughout the course, he&rsquo;s sharing various stories from the operations he&rsquo;s conducted.</p>

<p>The course is priced at 59$, but there are discounts every now and then. The training is video-based, where the instructor is sharing slides and talking about the topics. There are some valuable documents that can be downloaded, mainly templates and sample models for social engineering reports, plans and field notes guides. These can be used as starting points for your own operations.</p>

<p>As for the main structure of the course, it is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Introduction to social engineering</strong> &ndash; this covers the terminology around SE (it&rsquo;s getting tiring to type that) and goes through several examples</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attack vectors</strong> &ndash; very useful section for actually conducting a SE campaign, it goes over different techniques and tools for social engineering your target, with actionable tips that you can use right away to enhance your operations. It also summarizes an attack in a very clear way, through the Social Engineering Kill Chain</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodology</strong> &ndash; this is another very practical section that covers planning and execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information gathering</strong> &ndash; physical and digital techniques for information gathering. There is a gear list for physical reconaissance that makes for a good reference. However, I found the digital side to be under-represented, only Maltego and Metagoofill are discussed. I would have expected at least a breakdown of the SET functionality, and more demos about OSINT and conducting phishing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psychology &amp; manipulation</strong> &ndash; very applicable in day-to-day life, not limited to the field of security and SE, this describes various influencing and elicitation techniques that can be used to gain information or an expected behavior from a target. Not only that, but it also gives you awareness of such techniques being used on you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-verbal communicaton</strong> &ndash; this is where micro expressions and body language are discussed. It essentially gives you a roadmap for reading people&rsquo;s true feelings and intentions, detecting lies, and masking your own thoughts. Very practical to be aware of these thing in all kinds of settings and social interactions.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed this course and highly recommend it. What would have made it even better would have been a practical component in order to complete it, a lab or task around phishing / OSINT, especially since at the end you get a certification. That being said, this is a very solid course and you don&rsquo;t need to be social engineered to get it :D</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2017/04/09/ccna-cyber-ops-review/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-09T10:11:41+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2017/04/09/ccna-cyber-ops-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Cisco Cybersecurity Scholarship program has concluded for the first cohort, and I have been fortunate enough to make it into the program! Now that the course and 2 exams are over, and I have a brand new certification, I thought I&rsquo;d share some info about what is covered in the CCNA Cyber Ops study materials.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to thank Cisco for this amazing opportunity, and I wish more vendors would take their example. Yes, the latest exam price increase isn&rsquo;t nice, but this offering of a new certification&rsquo;s courses and exams to 10 000 people was an awesome move, especially for people who shared an interest in the security topics but wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to the certification path due to costs.</p>

<p>It also helped in bringing like-minded people together, creating communities and study groups over social media networks, and exchanging information about various security subjects.</p>

<p>So, what is this new CCNA that has the word &ldquo;cyber&rdquo; in it all about?</p>

<p>{% img center /images/study/cyber.JPG &lsquo;ccna cyber&rsquo; &lsquo;ccna cyber ops&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>The certification aims to prepare people for working as security analysts in a Security Operations Center. This is a blue-team focused certification, and here are the skills that it covers:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/study/skills.JPG &lsquo;ccna cyber skills&rsquo; &lsquo;ccna cyber ops skills&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>The scholarship consisted of 3 courses that had to be completed within 3 months, free vouchers for the 2 exams, and access to forums and mentors.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to cybersecurity</strong></p>

<p>The first course was a very basic introductory course on what cybersecurity is and why it is needed. You can take it for free from Cisco&rsquo;s Networking Academy. This was a prerequisite for starting the other 2 courses that actually made up the certification part.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Cisco cybersecurity fundamentals</strong></p>

<p>This second course was a blast! 14 sections, massive amount of material, both writen and videos, lots of information covered, I really enjoyed it! Some of it was review for me, but I also learned plenty of new things about DHCP relays, the CAPWAP protocol, the Security Onion suite, which is like the Kali of defensive security, and much more! The cryptograhpy section was excellently explained, and the Linux chapter might as well be a course in itself. Here&rsquo;s a list with some of the topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>networking stuff, protocols, attacks, devices</li>
<li>cryptography &ndash; detailed and easy to understand</li>
<li>general infosec concepts</li>
<li>web attacks</li>
<li>Windows and Linux sections with commands, filesystem structure, the ways the OS works, etc.</li>
<li>network and host security</li>
<li>various types of security devices and logs</li>
<li>different types of models that deal with threats</li>
</ul>


<p>A great addition to the study materials were the labs, where you could play with various OSes and tools in your browser, simulate attacks and react to different scenarios. It took a while for the labs to be initialized, but there were also walkthroughs for doing the lab, or skipping it altogether and following the steps instead.</p>

<p>You can find the exam topics for this course at <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna-cyber-ops/secfnd/exam-topics">https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna-cyber-ops/secfnd/exam-topics</a></p>

<p><strong>Implementing Cisco cybersecurity operations</strong></p>

<p>This course wasn&rsquo;t as big as the previous one, it had 13 sections and 2 appendices. It built up on the foundation of the other one, focusing on various aspects of incident response. It felt a bit rushed though, as it could have covered more material instead of breezing through, and the amount of typos that I found in it was pretty high. But overall, it was a good follow-up, and it had links for many resources where you could learn more. Some of the topics covered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>types of SOCs, NSM tools and data</li>
<li>incident analysis and threat hunting</li>
<li>CVSS scoring</li>
<li>data manipulation, correlation and normalization</li>
<li>incident detection and playbooks</li>
<li>incident response and automation</li>
</ul>


<p>The biggest problem that I faced before the exam was that the exam topics didn&rsquo;t follow the course content. Here is the exam guide: <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna-cyber-ops/secops/exam-topics">https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna-cyber-ops/secops/exam-topics</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, the mentors assigned to us were very helpful, and in addition to hosting webinars that reinforced the study material, they put together some documents that followed the exam blueprint and filled the gaps in information.</p>

<p>Overall, this has been a very interesting experience and I am happy to have participated in it! Again, hats off to Cisco for making this program available to security enthusiasts, and happy threat hunting!</p>

    <updated>2016-08-24T13:02:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/book-review-nmap-network-scanning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have read the so-called Nmap bible, the Nmap Network Scanning book written by the creator of Nmap himself. I&rsquo;ve decided to make
a new section on the blog with the books I&rsquo;m reading and that I find most useful. Needless to say, this was a great book, that has upped my
Nmap game considerably. Right from the start, I highly recommend this as a book that should be in the arsenal of every pentester, system admin,
network engineer or plain old computer guy. The amount of information you get out of it is not constrained to a specific field.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nmap-Network-Scanning-Official-Discovery/dp/0979958717/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=sensha10-20&linkId=791bdedacea7ac3bd1caea9852082708" target="_blank"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BIsSMZqML._SX382_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>If you have enjoyed the Stealing the Network series, you will love this one! The style is similar, after all, Fyodor is also a
co-author of that amazing series. The book is sprinkled with fictional stories that illustrate the use of Nmap, along with backstories
of engagements the author has participated in, and case studies of users improving Nmap for certain tasks. All these stories contain great
advice not just on the technical side, but also on best practices. For example, Fyodor stresses the fact of always confirming that the IP range
you received for an engagement actually belongs to the target organization &ndash; or else you might end up  scanning the wrong target..like the army :&ndash;)</p>

<p>There are also plenty of funny comments and geeky stuff, from the friendly tip that &ldquo;using Nmap from your work or school computer to attack
banks and military targets is a bad idea&rdquo; and the technique and Nmap command that Trinity used to scan the Matrix, to life-changing
advice that says &ldquo;In life&rsquo;s bleakest moments when all hope seems to be lost, what should you turn to? Nmap, of course !&rdquo;. By the way, if you are curious,
the above mentioned scan against the Matrix was performed with <code>nmap -v -sS -0 10.2.2.2</code>. Fyodor also made a list on his site of other
movies that showcased the use of Nmap, which you can find at <a href="https://nmap.org/movies/">https://nmap.org/movies/</a></p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m sure that you want to hear about the actual content that will help turn you into a network scanning wizard. There are tons
of resources presented, not just related to Nmap, that can facilitate the information gathering process, such as DNS tools. Every Nmap command
is described in detail, with actual examples of using it, what happens under the hood when you run it, and  the situation where it will come
most in handy. All the command line switches are covered individually, but also in combinations, for comprehensive coverage of different scenarios.</p>

<p>The book also contains a good amount of TCP information and low-level details of both Nmap and network operations in general, along with
beautiful and detailed diagrams. There is information on scrips and how to create your own to enhance Nmap, and also description of the code itself.
At the end, there is a reference guide for all commands. While some of the content is a bit dated, you can get the whole up-to-date information
on the <a href="https://nmap.org/">https://nmap.org/</a> site, for free!</p>

<p>Finally, this awesome book was created with open source tools. Hats off to Fyodor&rsquo;s support to the open source community.</p>

<h3>Flash review</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>in-depth coverage of all Nmap commands, their internals and use cases</p></li>
<li><p>low-level networking internals, comprehensive overview of how Nmap operates in the network environment itself</p></li>
<li><p>introduction to Nmap code and scripting</p></li>
<li><p>the use of the GUI is not neglected</p></li>
<li><p>some dated content, but the updated information is available on the site</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, an excellent book that opened my eyes to the extent one can use Nmap for penetration testing..in fact, with all the scripts that are
available, you can even conduct web app security checks just with Nmap!</p>
